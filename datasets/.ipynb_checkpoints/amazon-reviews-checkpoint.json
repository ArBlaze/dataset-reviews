    "Review Text": "When ‘The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo’ was first released in the United States it seemed to me that anyone with a heartbeat was reading or had read the thing. The 2005 Swedish book was released in 2008 in the United States and I bought a copy but only opened it in 2020. I never saw either the Swedish or American movie versions of the novel. The closest I come to sporting a tattoo are the nascent brown liver spots on my aging body. This book review is from the perspective of a near-sixty-year-old, pasty-white, bald unhip old turnip.The two main protagonists are Mikael Blomkvist, a 42-year-old reporter whose professional reputation has imploded, and Lisbeth Salander, a 24-year-old who’s an understandably troubled gifted computer hacker. The author describes Salander as “an information junkie with a delinquent child’s take on morals and ethics.” She is the most interesting eccentric character in the novel, but the mystery also has a handful of other compelling people. The stories about Blomkvist and Salander move along on independent lines until they meet a little more than half way through the book. Part of what kept me interested was curiosity in how these two unalike people would eventually get together. The mystery revolves around the disappearance of a 17-year-old female named Harriet Vanger which happen nearly forty-years ago. The novel has some unsettling scenes, especially involving sexual assault. Speaking as an American with New England sensibilities, I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing or unique to this Swedish storyline but the characters in the book have a very casual attitude about hooking up with sexual partners. Outside of the sexual assaults the hook-ups are not graphic in detail. There is a healthy dose of profanity in the book. The book also includes two maps and a Vanger family-tree breakdown which were very helpful.At no point did I become bored with ‘The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.’ There is also another plot line that is set aside until the conclusion of the mystery. I especially liked how Mr. Larsson includes the difficulties of having to make moral compromises and living with the consequences. It was an engaging mystery with a handful of disturbing scenes. If you find any of the deranged episodes a turn-on, maybe you should look into having a lobotomy. The novel ties up the two main storylines but leaves the social dynamics between Blomkvist and Salander somewhat up in the air in an effort to get the reader to read the next installment ‘The Girl Who Played with Fire.’ I sure will."

    "Review Text": "Im an american girl, and I could not get past the swedish names in the book. Every freaking page has so many swedish names, names of people, places etc. Its so annoying to try to read a book and every time you get to a word you dont know how to pronounce you sit there and try to say it in your head. I had to stop and get frustrated on every page and the names werent memorable because I didnt know what the heck they were. sooo i didnt know who was who as was so frustrated i just stopped reading it altogether. This is the first time in my life that I stopped reading a book for that reason. I know i probably sound crazy but I really just couldnt get past it."

    "Review Text": "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is mostly boring. The dialog is sometimes stilted.  It consists of too many speeches whose primary purpose is to advance the exposition. The lead characters, in the face of an imminent danger, do dumb things. Incredulously, the male lead gets more action than James Bond. Young, middle-aged, and married woman throw themselves at him. Even another male has the hots for him.The young female lead is a loner, who is mad at the world and has a general distrust of men. She is a psychologically damaged person and although it’s never delved into, she may have some form of autism. Her talents as a computer hacker and private investigator so immense that she does not seem like a person operating in real life. Her character would be more appropriate in a story set in a superhero universe.A large portion of the Larrson’s book is about the crooked dealings a Swedish financier. These passages come off as flat because he is never a fully developed as a character. He is more of a bogey man.The main story is about the investigation of the whereabouts of a girl from a wealthy family, who mysteriously disappeared in the 1960s. The plot meanders because it’s bogged down with way too many potential suspects who are mostly from her old-money family. The resolution of this story feels like it should be the ending of the book. However, there are multiple chapters that follow that seem more like an epilogue and are a chore to get through."

    "Review Text": "The problem with the books is that they are more about Blomkvist than lisbeth salander. She always comes late in the novels. supposedly she is the main character and therefore she should be an active from the very beginning, which makes the book more about investigation that than action, which wouldn’t be bad if she was more involved.I also find that there is too many characters, in my opinion a lot of unnecessary characters, and their names are so complicated and very much alike That is difficult to follow up, I understand it is a Swedish book but Simplicity is very valuable. I wish both Lisbeth and Blomkvist worked more closely together as it is they barely communicate and is mostly from a few computer frases.As they are the books are very complicated, a little boring and so much is unnecessary."

    "Review Text": "While I’ve read the later three books of the Millennium series, I’ve been wanting to read the first three since high school and the first welcomes you into something so twisted. It centers on Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist and publisher of his Millennium magazine and Lisbeth Salander, a punk genius computer hacker. They both become tied together on an investigation that centers on a women, belonging to a wealthy Swedish family, who vanished decades ago. During their investigation, they both tangle with their own personal troubled lives as well as their relationship that might turn into something else. It’s a very different type of mystery that will surely grab your attention, thanks to its two protagonists. While it’s plot has its surprising twists and turns, the moments between Blomkvist and Salander grabbed me the most as riveting. Slithering, sneaky and satisfying. <b>A (100%/Outstanding)</b>"

    "Review Text": "I'm not done reading this book yet, but here's my feelings so far about it. There are plenty of sweedish words I don't understand, but I skip over them and can still understand what they are referring to easily. The first 7 chapters are a bit difficult to understand because they are setting the scene for the bigger plot but there are two maps and a family tree included for reference. Once you get to chapter 8 things get interesting and exciting. This book is extremely well written with interesting characters, subplots, and relationships. It has little swearing so far (some big swears) and no blatantly sexual scenes yet. The characters sleep around but that's to be expected with family intruge and murder. It never goes into detail. It started out as an industrial mystery but quickly turned into more of a domestic mystery which made me happy. I prefer family drama compared to corporate drama. Nazis, drugs, and social services are mentioned along with darker subjects that add grit to the story and believability. I'll let you know how it goes later on. :)Halfway: I'm through half of the book and I can't bear to put it down. This is so well written and suspensful. I can't believe how much I'm enjoying this book. There were some graphic sexual scenes but nothing terribly horrific and it was all necessary to the plot. Anyways, such a good read so far and the plot is picking up fast! Absolutely worth my time and money so far!Finished: I have to say I'm a little torn with this book. I wish the main plot had ended differently. The sub plot was ok but not as interesting. The ending was still really good and wrapped everything up well. The main mystery was scary, thrilling, and serious. I loved reading the entire book and at no point was bored or disinterested. This author truly is amazingly good at writing thrillers.Note: the second and third book SUCK. Too mush blantent sex, lesbian sex, no plot, super slow, too many details, doesn't feel like this authors writing. The entire beginning doesn't matter to the rest of the book. I would stop at the first book or the characters will be ruined for you."

    "Review Title": "I couldn’t put this one down!",
    "Review Text": "The book, originally written in Swedish under the title Män som hatar kvinnor (lit. ‘Men Who Hate Women’), is a psychological thriller that tells of a journalist named Mikael Blomkvist who is hired by a wealthy businessman named Henrik Vanger to solve the decades-old murder of his niece. The story alternates between Mikael’s point of view and that of Lisbeth Salander, a young, troubled woman who is a ward of the state and also a brilliant freelance researcher and computer hacker. Their stories eventually intertwine as Mikael discovers that Lisbeth has investigated him and dug into his personal life.The book makes a lot of commentary on issues in Sweden, including residual Nazism, violence against women, ethics in journalism, and the question of the extent to which a person’s upbringing affects their responsibility for their actions. I feel like the author succeeded in bringing these issues to the forefront in the novel. At the same time, the novel contains a “locked-room mystery” that is engaging and kept me thinking of the book throughout the day and wanting to read more. The book is rather lengthy, but I never felt like any of it was superfluous. There are some graphic sexual and violent scenes in the book, so if that bothers you, you might want to pass on this one. Otherwise, if you like psychological thrillers and mysteries, this is an extremely well-written, and, as far as I can tell, well-translated novel that I highly recommend."

    "Review Text": "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is an intriguing book title.  It's also an intriguing description of the female protagonist in this story. She is a 24 year old computer hacker with a photographic memory, a screwed up personal life, and a big chip on her shoulder. The male protagonist is a disgraced financial journalist who has been found guilty of libel, and whose business magazine he is part owner of is on the verge of shutting down. The two are hired by the elderly head of a wealthy family to find out what happened to his beloved niece who disappeared 40 years prior.I loved this book in spite of the graphic sadistic violence and the unfamiliar Swedish names and words sprinkled through the book.  The plot was suspenseful and kept me interested right to the end. I am definitely looking forward to reading the other two books in the series."

    "Review Text": "As others have mentioned this book is slow off the mark; but eventually, maybe 30% of the way in (I'm reading the kindle edition so there are no page numbers),  we reach cruising speed at last.  Then it comes into its own as a really first-class thriller and the kind of book one doesn't want to put down.  My advice: it pays to persevere!At times, the language of the English translation is a bit too goose-steppingly wooden,  but one gets over that in short order.Some readers objected to the author's including a few menus for snacks enjoyed by the protagonists.  For my part, I found that of interest, and have adopted one of them for my own repertoire: marinated herring, sour cream or tadziki and chives, bread, beer.  Quick and nutritious. Thanks, Stieg!For truly boring, endless and perfectly irrelevant menu descriptions, one cannot beat the ones saddled  upon the reader in the appalling books #4 & 5 of the medieval saga _Game_of_Thrones_ by George R. R. Martin.  In comparison, Mr. Larsson is countless light years above that.Happy reading!"

    "Review Title": "A Very Good Second Novel, The First Robert Landon Novel",
    "Review Text": "\"Angels & Demons\" is a very good suspense thriller set primarily in The Vatican City.  The novel is the second novel by Dan Brown, the first being \"Digital Fortress\".  This is the first of the \"Robert Langdon\" series.  It is a medium length, fast paced novel that is written in modern conversational English and is mostly an easy read.  The chapters are mostly short and the novel can be read in intervals during work breaks, etc., without losing the flow of the story.  I liked it very much.Although somewhat similar in format to \"Digital Fortress\" this novel marks a distinct improvement and the story line is completely independent of \"Digital Fortress\".  There is little or no gratuitous vulgar language in this novel, another distinct improvement over \"Digital Fortress\".  \"Angels & Demons\" is dedicated specifically to Dan Brown's mother and I cannot help but wonder if this elevated the author's lexicon to a level more consistent with good literature.  The first novel was dedicated to both of his parents.The novel is primarily set in Vatican City and is a mystery thriller.  The story requires detective work of a more academic nature than the average violent street felony.  Although I am a retired detective and I read a good bit, I would not have been able to work though this case on my own, in the time allotted in the novel, without Robert Langdon's expertise.  I really enjoyed the academic aspect of this novel and this was my favorite part of the novel.  I did parallel reading and learned a good deal.This novel features yet another semi omniscient uber villain who cannot resist spewing background information to his victims.  Personally I last encountered this in \"The Lincoln Letter\", another academic mystery novel.  I never encountered villains of this nature in my professional career and I have concluded that this is a literary device to shorten and simplify the story.  I preferred this novel over \"The Lincoln Letter\".In summary, I really enjoyed this novel.  It is a distinct improvement over the author's first novel.  The two stories stand alone and a reader can skip the first novel without missing anything in this second novel.  Although very academic it is still a relatively easy read and I prefer it to other mystery novels by contemporary American male authors such as James Patterson and Dean Koontz.  I mean no disrespect to them, I just liked this novel better.  Thank You..."

How bad can it be?Pretty bad.The premise of the book, science vs. religion, is interesting.  But the story soon veers off into the improbable and then it lands in the absurd.The actual writing of the book is poor.  Many of the sentences sound like they were done by a 6th grader.  And the hero of the book, Robert Langdon, goes from one improbable, life-threatening, situation right into another, and then another.It's just a ridiculous book."

    "Review Text": "A neverending sequence of crises and turmoil, this first of the Robert Langdon series was Dan Brown's third novel. It's fast-paced action makes it a fun read, although some of the backstories often were distracting and wisely eliminated from the movie version. The historical context and scientific elements added interest, while often misstating reality and adding information that sometimes bogged down the story, but overall, it was an enjoyable fictional reading experience.The characters were interesting with a few fully developed, yet complex enough for their motives  to vary and become conflicted as the story progressed. Although much of the religious information was accurate, Brown obviously ignored, adapted, or invented several elements. As such, this is a novel garnished with some truth.I generally like the author's style and intense tone, while only wishing he used fewer words to make the storyline more consistent with the actual time realistically available to the characters.Brown's writing continues to improve with later books, but this one is essential to understanding  the Robert Langdon character and series.The Audible narration was a pleasant supplement, helping to drive the story forward, especially at one-and-a-half times speed. So glad Audible has this feature!A good book to read over several days or a couple of weeks because I found myself including online research to understand better some of the locations, historical, and scientific elements."

Tackling the centuries old debate of science vs religion as a backdrop to his adventure, Angels & Demons takes the reader on a fast paced wild ride of devotions taken to extremes and what can happen. Just because we can - does it mean we should?  The depth of the research for this book is staggering and makes the reader feel like they have been invited to glimpse inside the Vatican in ways few will ever really experience. It makes you want to go to Rome and follow the trail of the Illuminati and take in all the beauty and fine details lost by the overwhelming magnitude of the masters’ works.  Great book. Thoroughly enjoyable and easy to get wrapped up in it and lose track of time."

Dan Brown’s books are packed with historical information mostly about Christianity and Catholicism which is interesting but only to a point for those of us who are not that interested in the subject. I recall reading the da Vinci code years ago and enjoying it immensely. I believe this book which came before the da Vinci code was not particularly successful until after the da Vinci code was a hit and then people made it a best seller. Anyone who reads a fictional novel and gets near the end and then hears a voice in their head saying oh geez please just let this thing be over will hear that same voice here. Spoiler alert here – I found the ending to be less than satisfying because the location of the hidden antimatter bomb would have been searched, I believe. It didn’t seem credible or believable."

    "Review Text": "Dan Brown's \"Angels and Demons” focuses on Robert Langdon, a symbologist and expert on a secret society called the Illuminati, who is asked to investigate the murder of a scientist, Leonardo Vetra. The murder seems to be connected to the Illuminati, but Langdon has his doubts. For one thing, the Illuminati has been extinct for about two centuries. What's more, even if the organization had been revived, it probably would never sanction the murder of a scientist since it took the side of science over religion in the age-old conflict that underscored the Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries.After Vetra’s adopted daughter, Vittoria, is brought in to help Langdon find her father’s killer, they learn her father was working on a type of antimatter, whose destructive capability is about equal to that of a nuclear bomb. A canister with the antimatter has been stolen, and it’s thought to be in Vatican City, where the Pope recently died. So Langdon and Vittoria travel to the Vatican. The plot thickens when four cardinals, all candidates to be the new Pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria race against time to find both the canister of antimatter and the four cardinals, who face imminent death at the hands of someone, either the Illuminati, or some other party perhaps connected to it.“Angels and Demons” contains a lot of symbolism from the Illuminati days, along with plenty of intrigue. The novel, which takes place within a one-day time frame, is basically clothed in darkness and mystery. Much of it occurs at night after Langdon and Vittoria arrive in Rome. There they must travel the Illuminati’s Path of Illumination to the group’s secret meeting place in order to locate the antimatter and the missing cardinals. Langdon is the only key. Meanwhile the reader may get a few clues as to whether the relationship between Langdon and Vittoria will go any farther.Conspiracy buffs will love this book. But so will non-conspiracy theorists. One certainly doesn’t have to believe in conspiracies to be entertained by them. Even those who poke fun at such things as the Illuminati and arcane symbolism and networks of conspirators will find this book seductive and therefore difficult to put down."

Angels and Demons, although written first, was just as exciting as the Da Vinci code.  I read this on my Kindle and I was surprised by the number of chapters - 137 - and page numbers were not synced with the paper edition. But, nevermind, the length, it was a page turner and the short chapters did make it go quickly.  I read this while on vacation and it was a great way to make a 4 hour plane ride go quickly.  It has been a while since I saw the movie, but I think that the movie script did not follow the book as closely as the Da Vinci Code did and there were some minor differences with the characters, but the overall plot was the same. If you are looking for an exciting book that makes you think, gives factual information that maybe you didn't know and thoroughly keeps you involved and entertained, then this is the book for you."

Also, I had some unease about the idea that the white author was using black stories to sell a book - it felt a little like literary blackface.ANYWAY, reservations aside, I just completely and absolutely loved this. Lovely characters, nailbiting story (as much as I loved the book, I was terrified the whole time that The Thing was going to happen), beautiful message. It was just great. And it dealt with its subject matter with appropriate sympathy and sensitivity.For anyone not living on Earth, the story revolves around three characters, Skeeter (yup), a white girl who wants to be a writer and is told by a New York publisher to write about what she cares about, Aibeleen, a domestic helper (they are called \"maids\" in the book) who has lost her son but nonetheless loves the white people's children she cares for, and Minny, also a maid who has a bit of a problem with talking back to her unreasonable white employers.Well, it turns out that the thing that Skeeter cares about is civil rights (although she doesn't quite realise it yet). She sets about writing a book about the relationship between white Southern women and their help, and asks Aibeleen, who works for a friend of hers, to get other maids to talk to her. Only problem is that they are actually risking their lives - and certainly their livelihoods - to do so.The Help is an emotional rollercoaster with a touching message and a strong undercurrent of hope. If you, like me, weren't sure about reading it, I can't recommend it strongly enough."

    "Review Text": "I originally read the audio book edition of \"The Help\" by Kathryn Stockett and later read it on my Kindle for book club. The Help is most definitely on my short list for all time favorite books. I am not sure which was better the audio book or the Kindle read. This is the first novel by this author and I do not know how she will ever top herself. The book is about the relationship between White women living in the deep South in the early 1960's and their Negro domestic help. It shows a time, not all that long ago, when there was no such thing as political correctness, when Whites, especially in the South, had no problems showing their Negro help who was boss. At that time in Jackson, Mississippi, a Black woman was allowed in a White grocery store only if she was wearing her white maid's uniform. The grocery stores in the Negro section of town were not well lit, not too clean and not very well stocked. For a maid to speak out of turn was reason enough for immediate firing, if not putting herself and her family in physical danger. To characterize the racial condition of the American South in 1963 as American Apartheid, would not be an exaggeration. But, this is only the backdrop of the story. The real story is about the relationship that develops between one White woman, Skeeter and the Black maids, Abilene and Minny, she eventually writes a book about. Skeeter recently graduated from college with a degree in Journalism, which was all well and good, except all anyone, especially, in this case, Skeeter's mother, really expected from women who attended college in that time was to get their MRS.degree; anything less was all but useless. Skeeter, was an exception to the rule. She was determined to be a writer and unlike her close friends, with whom she played bridge on a weekly basis and was a member of the local women's organizations, Skeeter had a sense that all was not well regarding race relations in the South. In her attempts to find something worthwhile to write about, she decides on exploring what it is like for the \"colored maids\" to work for the white women of Jackson, Mississippi, from the maid's point of view. And so begins the relationship that develops between Skeeter and Abilene and Minny, who work for her friends. The author, who is White, takes on the task of giving voices to the Negro maids who are interviewed for her book and those voices are believable and pitch perfect. This was the first book I have read in many years, perhaps decades, in which I felt a kinship with these main characters to the extent that I already miss them, as if they had been guests staying at my home and have now left, leaving me with a sad void. I hope that Kathryn Stockett sees fit to write a sequel to\"The Help\", so that her readers can know what happens to her characters in the years to come. If you are an avid reader or if you only read a few books a year, you will want to read \"The Help\"."

At first,I thought I might be put off by that choice, but once you adjust to the different voices, the rhythm adds an element to the book that a single point-of-view wouldn't have provided. The three principal characters speak for themselves.There are profoundly moving moments in the book and the movie. There are some surprising passages. Kathryn Stockett's humor is a riot. I wasreminded of some of the funniest lines in Steel Magnolias, but I think that the humor is much more deftly handled in this book.I wish that I had written The Help. I'm glad that I read it.

The book was published in 2011, but I read an excerpt last week and was intrigued enough to buy the book. And it turned out not to be the “book club” book I had assumed it to be. It was deeper and the characters more subtle and nuanced than I would have thought.“The Help” is not the first book I’ve read on black/white relations in the 1960’s Deep South. Both Anne Rivers Siddons in her first novel, “Heartbreak Hotel” and the movie, “The Long Walk Home” with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek, cover the same subjects with many of the same characters and plots. Small town wealthy white girl who goes off to college and returns home with an increasingly enlightened view of the society in which she was raised. That society held firm the separation between whites and blacks.As the inequality, both in financial and  societal terms come clear to her, she decides she must do something to help those in need. Both books and the movie take place in the deepest of the South - Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.In “The Help” the emphasis is on “Skeeter”, who grows up in the conventional white family in Jackson, Mississippi. They belong to the “right” country clubs, pray at the “right” churches, and buy their clothing at the “right” stores. Their friends are from the “right” families and their lives continue in the same way, generation after generation. They are also attended through life by their black “help”; black women who raise the white babies, clean the white homes, and cook the white meals. Stockett pays as much attention to the black help as she does the white employers.The 1960’s are a time of change in the American South. But for those changes to occur, they must first be pointed out. And that’s what Kathryn Stockett does in her book as she portrays Skeeter looking around her for the first time, wondering why things are they way are, and always have been. She decides to write a book, interviewing 14 or so black maids. The black help (after much persuasion) finally tell of their experiences - both good and bad.“The Help” is a great book. It’s one of those novels that you finish, wondering what happens to the characters. Will Stockett write a sequel? Probably not if she hasn’t done so in ten years."

    "Review Text": "Kathryn is a master of the story of the south. She is a master storyteller. I felt like the characters were talking to me. Description, dialogue details, all A++. If you don't know the story, it takes place in segregated Jackson Mississippi in the late 1950's to the mid 1960's. Life for a black person is brutal but a change is coming. The story revolves around white families of privilege and their \"colored\" maids. Life is good... If you're white. Sorority queens do charity work and hold parties and play bridge, while the help struggles on far less than minimum wage. Then \"Miss Skeeter\" decides to write a book about the oppressive, racist system... And Jackson,  Mississippi will never be the same again. Take a look back at one of America's most shameful periods... Although I'm sure there are plenty of people in TRUMP'S Amerika who long for a return to this way of life. Make sure your kids read it."

    "Review Text": "Gripping account of racial interactions in the deep South in the 1960's by an author who grew up there in the aftermath of the Civil Rights struggle. The book does have its flaws. How many times can the central characters \"narrow\" their eyes and how many times can the protagonist escape her parents suffocating attention to meet with her friend's black housekeeper without being found out? The plot may stretch credulity towards its conclusion, yet the book is hard to put down. Black critics have pointed at negative black stereotypes, especially black men but, valid or not, the story mostly rings true while projecting a ringing indictment of the 1960's white community. As such it serves as a powerful reminder today that much more progress must yet be made if the US is ever to be home to a racially egalitarian society."

    "Review Text": "I read this book when it first came out, then during the process of a divorce and moving it got lost. I happened to see the movie and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed this book. So I purchased it again, and it really doesn't disappoint. It's written from the perspective of \"the help\" in the south in the 1960's, with insight from their \"bosses\". I hate to use that word, but I can't think of anything else that fits. In reality, the help is a step up from slavery in what they are asked to do. Skeeter is an aspiring author and has always loved the African American workers in her home, usually more than she loves her own family. She has the opportunity to make it in writing, but she needs the servants' assistance. Reluctantly over time, they agree, on the condition of anonyminity. Some of the employers are downright kind and loving and treat their help as family. Most are not and treat their help appallingly. As Skeeter's book becomes published, many of the employers try to figure out who is who in the book. Some are honored at what was written, others are furious. This is a great book and I've read it several times now."

    "Review Title": "Sorry, but I'm not a fan of the South",
    "Review Text": "The pathetic thing is, I want this book not to be based off real history.  The history of the South seriously gives me a headache thinking of how stupid people are. (I say \"are,\" because people are still stupid, but in different ways these days).But that's the way of a story.  You're supposed to root for the protagonists and wish the worst for the ridiculous antagonists.  I definitely got that feeling while reading this book.  Still, the characters are rounded enough with opposing qualities.  Hilly's a good mom (not all evil).  And Minny (though a protagonist) can't hold her tongue even if she super-glued it between her fingers.  And Miss Skeeter could do some growing up (which we all could at 24, when we've graduated from college and think we know what's best for ourselves and the world.) :PI'll admit, I did have a little trouble listening and reading, because... I don't speak Southern.  From Audible, I kept wondering \"Was that what I thought I heard?  Do they have different definitions for words there, or am I just hearing something else through the accent?\"  The book's spelling and grammar is halfway to \"Tom Sawyer,\" and there were just as many instances where I had to re-read a sentence, saying the sentences aloud or fast.  Sometimes, I felt like I was playing Mad Gab with the book.Unfortunately, my biggest qualm was the ending.  SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH FOR SPOILER ALERT:  Sure, each character's given hope with new opportunities, but the conflict didn't really feel settled.  It's not the kind of \"unsettled\" where you think they'll write a second book either.  To quote my English teacher, \"They either need to live happily ever after or all be killed off - just don't make them live the normal life!\"  It's unsatisfying!  Though \"The Help\" left with that sense of new beginning, I did get a bit of that unsatisfying normal-life feeling.Anyway, sure, I liked it.  I'll look up the movie and make comparisons.  Do I think I'll read it again?  If I ever get the urge to dive into the Jim Crow South (unlikely), I'll pick it up."

    "Review Title": "An Awesome Ending. Anything else would have been unrealistic.",
    "Review Text": "Before reading The Hunger Games trilogy, I had more than a few people tell me the first two books were good, but the last one was lacking.  I couldn't disagree more.  The story is harsh, gruesome, and bleak.  It had to be.  It's a first person account of an individual who has survived two Hunger Games and plays a major role in a revolution.  Of course it's going to be brutal.  Had the story drawn to a close with Katniss standing majestically with trumpets blaring and flags waving, it would have been completely unrealistic.I also heard a few people express disappointment in the conclusion of the Katniss/Peeta storyline.  I've read people's reviews taking issue with how Katniss and Peeta are represented at the end of Mockingjay, asking \"Where's the passion?\" Passion?  Are they insane?  First of all, the story is told in first person by a character who is admittedly not at all comfortable being demonstrative and doesn't respond well to those who are.  There was never going to be a hearts/candy/flowers declaration happening here.  Peeta has a borderline obssessive love for Katniss throughout most of the trilogy.  The way I read the story, by the end of the first Hunger Games, she returns the feeling.  Though hesitant to think why she does the things she does, or to state it aloud, she expresses it in so many different ways throughout the remainder of the trilogy, there really is no doubt. Despite the fact that she is suffering major PTSD, she agrees to take on the stress of being the symbol of revolution and take a front line role to bring him back.  Regardless of the amount of trauma they both endure, they still eventually turn back to each other.  Gale was a strong character, but he had not gone through what Katniss did in the arena and would never have been able to understand that part of her.  The time she spends clinging to him and avoiding Peeta is essentially an attempt to return to the person she was before the games (which was never going to happen). Peeta was the walking, living, breathing reminder of the trauma endured.  I thought it telling that Peeta returned to Region 12.  Like Gale, he could have gone anywhere when it was all over, yet he went where Katniss was.  Really, Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch needed each other to become human again (or as human as they were ever going to be).  Katniss reminded me of uncles I had who, when they returned from war, sat in a darkened room, staring at a wall day after day for over a year before they could handle being amongst the living again.I'll admit part of me would have liked President Snow's demise to be more than it was.  Considering the amount of suffering he caused, part of me is bloodthirsty enough to have wanted him to suffer a great deal more.  There are also characters I would have liked to survive (Finnick, Cinna, and Prim to name a few), but their deaths helped to illustrate the randomness and unfairness of death in wartime.There are parts of this story we'll never get to see because it is told from Katniss' point of view.  We see only what she sees and know only what she thinks is going on.  I, for one, would be interested in knowing more about events of the story from Peeta and/or Haymitch's point of view.  Peeta's fight back from his memory hijacking would be an intriguing read.Ultimately, I found this book engaging, infuriating, exhausting, and funny all at the same time.  To have had Katniss serene and sweetly declaring life to be sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows would have been absurd. She is with a husband (partner?) whom she loves and is utterly devoted to.  She has two children she loves, but is worried what they will think when they know the role their parents played in the past.  She and Peeta are happy, but remain somewhat haunted which is perfectly realistic for what the characters have gone through."

    "Review Title": "The Most Meaningful Book of the Trilogy",
    "Review Text": "You know a book is good when it crawls inside your head and snuggles there.  When you are thinking through it as you read it, and thinking about it long after you’ve read the last word on the last page.I had little to no expectations when I first started reading the Hunger Games Trilogy.  If a book is trending and seems interesting, I will add it to my “to read” list.  This is how I first started reading Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games.  After finishing Mockingjay, I was blown away.  All I could think was, how many of the YA readers will understand the nuances of Collins’ message?She hooked you in with the “will she or won’t she” scenario.  “Will she or won’t she” pick Peeta or Gale?  “Will she or won’t she” survive a game that does not allow for love to shine through?  Those questions get you through the first book, and possibly half way through the second book, but those same questions are a moot point with Mockingjay.Mockingjay stripped you of your hopeless romantic naiveté.  There is no room for romance when the world is collapsing around you.  There is barely room to breathe.  There are no good guys or bad guys, only survivors.  Mockingjay asks difficult moral questions:  can man ever hold seats of power without corruption?  Can war ever actually solve a dispute?  At what price is man willing to pay for absolute power?I won’t even go into Collins’ varied symbolisms.  Part of the pleasure of reading is finding them yourselves and asking yourself what the author is telling you, the reader.  It becomes a communication between the author and the reader.  It makes the novel Mockingjay even more important because it is written for younger readers, our future, those that will decide the world events of tomorrow.  Collins does all this without a lecture, without loosing her characters or her plot, she has crafted an incredibly well written story that I would gladly recommend to anyone who asks.After I finished reading Mockingjay I had the same feeling as I had when I finished reading The Lord of the Flies so many years ago.  Yes, I am comparing Mockingjay to a classic.  There is no way around it.  Mockingjay, like Lord of the Flies, asks you deep moralistic questions through the point of view of young characters.  This is simply another great novel that makes you go hmmm.My favorite quotes from Mockingjay:“Frankly, our ancestors don’t seem much to brag about.  I mean, look at the state they left us in, with the wars and the broken planet.  Clearly, they didn’t care about what would happen to the people who came after them.”“It’s a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a language called Latin about a place called Rome,” he explains.  “Panem et Circuses translates into ‘Bread and Circuses’.  The writer was saying in return for full bellies and entertainment, his people had given up their political responsibilities and therefore their power.”“Something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children’s lives to settle its differences.”"

As a psychologist who specializes in the treatment of trauma, I never expect a fiction piece to truly capture PTSD accurately.  That is why we call it fiction. But the emotions Katniss experiences are real, raw, complicated,and expressed beautifully.  Recovery from the horrors she saw, the physical traumas she experienced , and the childhood events she survived, take years, and are powerfully conveyed."

They ask too much.Katniss is not a real lovable character. She’s brash, rude, and choppy. She is also every bit as much like every one of us readers at some point or other. She excels at surviving because that all she expects to do. She’s alive due to great effort by more than a few people. Please, never think that you are expected to make it on your OWN. Never reduce your efforts to “not enough”, because you were never expected to carry yourself, much less anyone else.It takes a village, they say. What does that even mean!? I think it means that it takes more than one person to raise another. No one wants an exact replica of themselves floating around. That’s a guarantee of mistakes to be made. A promise that no forward motion will take place. A vow that the end is brought on by and shaped by YOU. The responsibility is f that is too much. So, we get Katniss. A person who reacts. Who feels fear and hope, constantly at war with rationale and fantasy. We get Katniss, so like ourselves, a mixed bag. Full of contradictions and false positives, that we can begin to forgive her urge to sever ties. Her penchant to deflect attention and the core avoidance of relationships. We see that she has all that f our flaws and enough beyond that it’s ok to dismiss her. And yet, she prevails. Because, like us, despite all she’s been through, despite her personal failings, she continues  to try. That may be her only redeeming quality. The very strong sense of self  that leads her to make a better path for others.No other character is more dynamic, or more utterly condemnable , than that of Katniss Everdeen. And  none more deserving of the title, Victor.  Cheers, Ms. Collins, on another epic, another daily tale of love, loss, and revolution."

    "Review Title": "Collins disposes of her characters rather than completing character arcs",
    "Review Text": "***Warning--major spoilers ahead...Upon finishing Mockingjay, I concluded two things: 1) this trilogy is a tragedy, and 2) Suzanne Collins believes executing a character arc is as simple as executing the character.  Here's why:Finnick: Shortly after his wedding, Finnick--one of the few characters who is actually somewhat developed throughout the story--is eaten by lizard monsters on a mission that was ultimately completely and utterly futile.  His sacrifice (if it can be called that) meant very little, if anything, to the story.Prim: The entire plot of the trilogy centered on the attempt to keep her alive, and she is killed in a random bombing at the end, as Katniss watches from a few feet away.  The entire plot of the story hinged on saving Prim from the evils of the age, and that battle is lost in a very grim way.  Katniss did not need her heart ripped out in this way to make the decision she made at the end.  This was an extra knife in the gut from an author who enjoyed bitter ends for key characters.Peeta: Though a large portion of the first book sets up Peeta and Katniss for a deep relationship, that relationship is largely ignored throughout the entire second and third books in favor of a shallow coexistence.  Peeta instead becomes a sort of zombie trying to kill Katniss, and never quite recovers; this leeches from Peeta his most valuable quality, which was his commitment to keeping Katniss alive.  Sure, he saves her at the end with his miraculous appearance at Katniss' attempted suicide, but without others' prior interventions, he would have already killed her on multiple occasions.  It seems as though nothing between his capture at the end of the second book and his appearance at the assassination at the end was either necessary or supportive of the plot.  He's tossed in at the end for a happily-ever-after that is anything but happy.  He deserved more and better--from the author as well as Katniss.Gale: This is perhaps the most tragic of treatments.  Gale's death would have preserved his character, but instead, Collins assassinates his character rather than taking his life.  In the last few pages, I was waiting and wondering how Katniss' first and oldest friend would make his return and begin the impossible task of making up for his role in Prim's death.  Instead, the reader is robbed of any closure beyond their insufficient parting at the Capitol.  The person who had vowed to protect Prim and had been there for Katniss--usually behind the scenes for the length of the trilogy--had failed in the most ironic of fashions and finally gave up on the Everdeens in the end.  He'd taken some job in another district, and the reader is left to assume that he and Katniss' relationship had died with Prim.  This isn't characteristic of Gale as we'd come to know him.  Had he died nobly at the end, perhaps to once again protect Prim, that would have stayed much truer to his character.  In my opinion, Collins certainly did not complete his character arc successfully, and traded plot for shock.Katniss: In the third book, it becomes more obvious with every page that Katniss' story is a full-on tragedy.  The reader loses a great deal of sympathy for her as she stops caring about those around her, and in her pusuit of killing Snow, she begins to kill civilians in the capitol.  3/4 of the way through Mockingjay, I found myself wondering why I was supposed to be rooting for Katniss anymore.  Her character degrades into little more than a tool of the revolution, without any kind of motivation beyond vengeance.  The entire push toward the capitol is a totally futile errand that accomplishes nothing but death; all those Katniss loves are either killed or broken along the way.  In the final pages, the reader is left with a smoldering ruin of a cast and story, with only a glimpse of future hope for something better.  Unfortunately, I didn't grow to care much for the nameless faces of Panem's future; I cared for the characters of these three books.Make no mistake--I enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy, and Mockingjay was an engrossing read that kept my attention.  I didn't expect hugs and rainbows at the end, but in any form of literature, the reader can only hope that the characters' existence had a good purpose and a satisfying end in the fictional world in which so much time has been spent.  Viewed as a larger story, I don't think Collins told a satisfying tale.  Whether or not that was her intention, I'm not sure, but as a reader, I felt her treatment (or perhaps more accurately, her disposal) of many of these characters was ultimately disappointing."

    "Review Title": "I'm not going to tell you not to read it but...",
    "Review Text": "Say what you will about how readers might not like this book because they wanted a \"fairy-tale ending\", or because they don't \"get\" how profound it was; the fact of the matter is, this book is objectively bad. Not bad as in evil, but bad as in exhibiting poor craftsmanship. The storytelling is ineffective, incoherent and nonsensical.  The conflicts are contrived, the characters are soulless and Katniss' motivation becomes overpowered by the author's need to wrap up the rebellion.In the end Katniss' character is on the receiving end of the most horrific assassinations in the book. Throughout the last 2/3rds of the book she is reacting in a numb, zombie-like state as the events of the world close in around her. She has no clear motive, her self-sacrifice at the beginning of the Hunger Games turns into a muddled and confused array of reactions and rash decisions. Good authors give the lead character a choice in which there are two equally compelling options. In the end of this book, Katniss generally either has no choice or the ones that she makes are obvious.Like a previous reviewer said, I did indeed want to see Katniss infiltrate the capital and take Snow down. But that didn't happen. I am really okay with that not happening. I like the gritty realism that the author was going for. However, nothing Katniss does contributes very strongly to how things turn out. Snow was practically brought to her on a silver platter after someone (once again) rescued her from near death. She is the worst heroine in history. Everything she does fails and the only reason she survives in the end is because of the help of other people. The other characters keep talking about how powerful she is and in the end she is the most useless part of the rebellion. I'm not exaggerating when I say the author couldn't have made a worse ending if she would have had Katniss accidentally blowing up Snow by tripping over her own bomb-rigged shoelaces. That is not a spoiler, by the way, but a much more entertaining version of how the book ends. Some call this feminist friendly, but I would say that if you think feminism means that women can't do anything right, always make stupid decisions and that mothers can be so callous as to just abandon a child having gone through serious trauma (Katniss' mother doesn't even visit her after the rebellion is over, she's like \"call me when you get out of solitary confinement - toodles!\"), then it is feminist friendly. I have a different view of feminism, so I disagree.The worst part is when some no-name character becomes the new president. What was all this build up for, so someone for which the reader cannot possibly have any sympathy can take over? I mean really, there was no character from the first two books that could have not died and stepped up to be the new president? There were three questions that I wanted answered, three questions which led me to read non-stop through the entire series. One of them was not when, but how Katniss would overtake Snow. Okay, so she does, kinda, but I really think tripping over her shoelaces would have legitimately been way better. The second was Gale or Peeta. Okay and she chooses Peeta because as it turns out Gale, like Katniss, is a little bit of a hot-head. Gale was like, \"mighta bombed your sister, whoopsie-doodle\". Okay he didn't say that, but he might as well have because the actual conversation between Gale and Katniss in the book was way more superficial and pointless. Well, that was kinda lame, and again doesn't really give Katniss much of a choice. I guess the author might have picked up on the fact that it takes more than bread-making savvy and cake decorating wizardry to create a convincing teen heartthrob, so she just tried to even the playing field a bit. And you know what, I'm still not convinced that Pete was the right choice considering his homicidal tendencies but I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. The third thing that kept me reading was who would take over when the rebellion ended. Coin was shady from the start, I knew that. You wanted to know that the rebellion wouldn't end in leadership worse than Snow. And so Katniss' decision to vote for the next wave of Hunger Games then shoot Coin was actually pretty decent. However, who was that no-name looser they elected for the new president? There are no words to describe the antipathy I have for that resolution. I felt robbed. Okay, so people don't write long-winded rants about books that are completely bad. I am upset because the elements for a great book were all there. But the fact of the matter is, while I rooted for the characters in the first two books of the trilogy, in this one I found myself rooting for the Mutts so the book could be over and the characters would stop annoying me. I was even glad to see Prim go because she didn't do anything but act helpless. And don't get me started on her stupid cat buttermilk or whatever its name was. Why were whole minutes of my life taken from me by reading about that stupid cat with its stupid attitude? I think this book was rushed and that the author could have done much better with rewrites and even remotely competent editors. Stay away from this one if you can. But if you are like me and cannot resist reading because of the first two, be prepared for a let-down."

    "Review Text": "If you love the slow budding, complicated and raw relationship between Peeta and Katniss and you just can't wait to read the ending that Suzanne Collins would write, because you just KNOW that she'll do right by them and give them the kind of ending that two people who have been through so much hurt, and pain, and hardship deserve, well- you won't find it here! The ending of a three book series consists of a five page wrap up. WTF Suzanne Collins... WTF.  I sincerely hope whatever writers get hired to do this movie have a better understanding of your own audience then you do! With a story this complicated a wrap up is NOT the kind of ending your audience was looking for.I wrote my own ending, if you'd like to read it go for it:Continuing from where Katniss says, she gave all her bacon to Buttercup….The days start to go by, somehow. Life continues. It's funny like that. Even when everything you love has disappeared from the face of the Earth, never to be seen again, their laughter never to be heard again, their smiles never to be seen again… life does go on in the cruel way that it does. What I had thought was impossible begins to happen without my knowledge- it crept up on me. I slowly started to accept the fact that the lives lost, the ones I cared for, are gone. I will have to continue my life without them here with me. At least not physically. Sometimes I would talk to them when I had no one else to turn to- after Greasy Sae left for her own makeshift home where the Hob used to be. It seems weird to admit it to myself, but I begin to crave human company. After being constantly surrounded by people, the solitude that I was used to before the madness of the Hunger Games seems so foreign to me now that I’m home. That's when I talk to Prim about random things that I see throughout the day, or to Cinna, describing to him the colors that I see around me, or to Finnick, telling him about how Annie was doing according to the letters she sends faithfully every month.One late afternoon I muster up the energy and set off to the meadow, place my bow down next to me and throw aside my shoes to try to find a grain of peace here that my home can never give. The grass and leaves are lush and green- soft under my feet, I try to recount the good things that once happened here gail, my father, even the crew members from 13. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, willing myself not to think of the staggering loss that threatens the corners of my mind.  I recite in my head the phrases I so often replayed in my mind, my meager attempt to hold on to my sanity: my name is Katniss Everdeen. I am eighteen. I live in District Twelve. I am the Mockingjay. I was the Mockingjay. The Capitol is gone. Gale, my best friend, is now in District Two. He is safe. I don't know where I stand with Peeta but Peeta is safe. I'm back home in District Twelv., I am finally safe. I let out a deep breath as I open my eyes and stare at the sky, lying down in the Meadow where the new buds of life cushion my body from the soil underneath. The sun has just begun to set and the sky was magnificent, painted in shades of light pinks, dull yellows, brilliant reds, and soft hues of orange. Orange. Seeing his favorite color painted all across the endless sky triggers an influx of memories. Its so hard having him live so close and yet knowing how far away we really are. I find myself longing for the feeling of his hand in mine- the way his eyes used to light up just for me. The way he always double knotted his shoelaces, the relief and the surge of warmth that I felt when we kissed. Really kissed. That relief and surge of happiness that I was too afraid to admit to myself was present when he was finally safe, when he was finally near, back at district 12. The feeling of elation when he wrapped his arms around me as we fell into the soft pillow of snow as one. That seems so long ago.I closed my eyes, imagining his beautiful blue eyes which used to bring such warmth, trying not to forget them and the way they pierced into mine in the gentlest way possible, filled with undeniable love. The way he used to look at me never has fully returned since the Capitol hijacked his memories. Their plan did not prevail, but in some ways, the Capitol and Snow had their victory before their downfalls. Although Peeta was not successful in killing me physically, they took the only sure thing I knew. Peeta loved me, he loved the heartless girl who doesn't trust a soul in the world other than herself. It killed me to know that although he was pronounced \"recovered\" by Dr. Aurelius, he never truly will be. The light that always shined in his eyes is gone and replaced with something hollow. And that is how Snow and the Capitol took their final revenge.Peeta and I haven't spoken since he planted the primrose bushes. He somehow managed to finish planting the bushes before I woke up in the morning and as a result my house in the Victor's Village is now surrounded with primrose bushes, waiting for summer to breathe in a breath of life. In the mornings I would wake up to the sweet aroma of bread wafting through the house and find downstairs a fresh cheese roll every day left on the counter. Even though the gesture was simple, it hit me every time with a pang of longing mixed in with a bit of sadness. It reminds me of the way he used to care for me, of memories long ago, how I would wake up from my nightmares and feel safe to be in his arms, and how ever since I got back home I would wake up screaming only to be comforted by the soft kitten mews of Buttercup instead. I relished his company and the way he protected me just as he did with Prim, yet it was nothing compared to waking up and feeling secure in the strong arms of Peeta. The one who understood.I closed my eyes, blocking out the hues of orange in the sky that reminded me so much of him, and whispered to no one in particular his name. Peeta. It felt good to say his name out loud and not hear it revolve in my head with the list of others I’ve hurt. As I let another quick breath out, my experienced hunting senses felt the vibration of someone's footsteps ever so gently shaking the Meadow. The footsteps stopped next to where my bow was, and not bothering to open my eyes I asked, \"Done recovering from your latest hangover, Haymitch?\"The voice that answered me back wasn't what I had been expecting at all.\"Last time I checked, I wasn't intoxicated out of my mind, but to answer your question, probably not. I went into his house to bring him some fresh bread this morning and he was completely out of it. But Greasy Sae's doing a nice job of keeping his house clean. I hardle recognize it without all the mold and clutter.\"My eyes snapped open. The view that greeted me was such a surprise,  his body so close to mine,  his voice finally sounding the way it did before the Capital got him. Its taken months for even minor healing, but this is the greatest improvement of all. To hear his voice, the voice of reason, of comfort, the voice that could change the world. His eyes were a clear yet smoky blue, staring at me with hesitation of what my reaction would be seeing him here- yet I did nothing. My eyes stared into his searchingly, looking for the piece of Peeta I longed for to come back. And it was there. Almost completely. The care that I was so used to seeing, the love that I had taken for granted. He was almost there.I couldn't believe it at first. The fact that he was standing there, in front of me, as if we didn't ignore each other for the past two months. As if we didn't secretly keep track of where the other went so that we wouldn't bump into the other despite being neighbors. Yet he was still there after I closed my eyes briefly to make sure that I wasn't imagining it. Sometimes I would see Prim next to me, with her shirt untucked, making her look like a little duck. But he was still there after I opened my eyes. This was real. He had finally come for me.\"Hi Katniss\" he says. His tone full and sounding steady, and at that moment I wanted to melt into his arms as if nothing happened, and just tell him all the things that only he can understand- things like nightmares about the arena, the fear and paranoia of the Capitol and Snow somehow  reappearing back in power. The constant flashbacks that haunt my mind. Resisting my urge to dig my way into his arms, feeling the hollow places of my body crying out for him. I managed to choke out a \"Hi yourself\".He sat down next to me in the grass, looking not at me, but up at the sky. Then he closed his eyes and sighed.\"You were right, this kind of orange is my favorite color. My memories are starting to come back. My real memories. It's like the effects of the hijacking are finally wearing off and my brain can distinct what is real and what is not more easily than it could before. Some days everything seems fake and I can't remember what's real at all, but I somehow manage to get through it and the truth comes back.\"I hear him rambling, searching for the right things to say- things that won't bring up sensitive topics that will hurt me, cause me to run. But I don't. I go back to closing my eyes and soak in the sound of his voice and let it soothe me. Its been so long since we’ve talked like this. To have him so near me, his hand so close to mine without touching- it feels strange. Wrong, in some way. I couldn't remember a time where we were talking like this and not touching him in some way. I craved the soft touch of the skin on his hands- the smell of spices.In a moment of weakness, I can’t fight it anymore and tentatively reach out my hand, closing the space that was between. I felt my fingers find his, and fill in the spaces between his fingers, wrapping mine around his. I felt him stiffen, and for a brief moment, I opened my eyes in fear that he would pull away, revolted by my touch. His eyes were squeezed shut and he seemed to be in battle with himself. Yet the battle was over as soon as it had begun. He muttered something under his breath… something that sounded like the word \"always\". Then he opened his eyes and looked right into mine for few glorious seconds before flitting away. As he stared into the sky once more, I gave his hand a squeeze, remembering the first moment his fate intertwined with mine. And for the first time ever, a memory associated with the Hunger Games brought a smile upon my face- remembering the reassuring squeeze he gave me that very first day. He was there for me even before I knew I needed him.Peeta closed his eyes and gave a small sigh. Then, he squeezed my hand back and I saw a smile slowly unfolding across his face, reminding me of the Peeta I knew. The yellow dandelion in the spring, representing all that is good and hope for the future. We lay in the Meadow until the sky turned into night, revealing a magnificent myriad of stars spreading infinitely across the sky, hand in hand, then arm in arm until he’s holding me just as before. Just lying there, grateful for the other's company. As we begin to drift off he whispers, “ You love me real or not” and after all we’ve been through and wrestled with I know I can finally say “Real.” He nestles his face in my neck and we both drift in to a peaceful sleep.Epilogue."

    "Review Title": "A downer",
    "Review Text": "This book was something of a disappointment, because it took me to places that I really didn't want to go. I grew up reading books about the Holocaust, World War II etc. As an adult I am so \"over\" the subject of war, suffering and mass slaughter.The first book showed Katniss' resourcefulness and compassion during the Games, making her an appealing character. But by the third book, Katniss' only function is to provide a 'symbol' for the revolution. She is mostly a passive participant who sits around suffering in excruciating detail. More than I really wanted to read.I'm sure it's possible to write a war/revolution novel without focusing on the blood & gore. Show us some other things: a little more depth about the other districts, a few more clever strategies that didn't rely on slaughter, maybe even some scenes with Capitol residents who sympathize with the rebels. Maybe even a little humor to lighten things up!I found it irritating that the author kept pulling the same strings; overusing the love-triangle plot, televising the revolution and having a 'prep team' that makes Katniss look beautiful even while she's an emotional wreck. This is the problem with a trilogy: authors either have to keep recycling plot points, or come up with something even more outrageous. This is one reason that I, as a writer, am sick of all these trilogies. It really does become a soap opera. Come to think of it, Books 2 and 3 of this series might have worked better as a single book.SPOILER SPOILER,I kept trying to guess how this would end. I thought Katniss would be hunting President Snow through the Arena. With Plutarch filming it, of course. It would have been such a logical development, since the Arena was such an important part of the other books,  that I'm a bit disappointed that it didn't happen that way.Anyway, I'm sure that the film makers will just love doing this film because it has what they love the most: lots of explosions, gore and horror."

The last time I did a reread was when I bought the illustrated edition and of course, it all started with me looking at the beautiful illustrations and the next thing you know I was lost to this world.

I, of course, cannot recommend them enough regardless of format. The movies are brilliant, but only scratch the surface of what the books and audios have to offer.

    "Review Text": "Eleven-year-old Liesel Meminger is a foster child who has recently arrived in a small town outside Munich, Germany during WWII. Liesel has been sent to live with Hans and Rosa Huberman, presumably for the small stipend they’ll receive. Liesel is still suffering from the loss of her little brother and the difficult and somewhat mysterious separation from her mother. She takes an immediate like to Hans, who is kind and thoughtful, but takes much longer to warm up to the abrasive Rosa.Liesel makes friends with next-door neighbor Rudy and establishes herself as a self-proclaimed book thief. Becoming unlikely friends with the Mayor’s wife Ilsa affords Liesel the opportunity to read the books in the Mayor’s massive library. Along the way, Liesel is witness to the atrocities of war, heartbreaking events, love, loss and other life-changing events.I saw the movie The Book Thief several years ago and loved it. When I decided it was time to read the book I was absolutely captivated. Although the book is 550 pages long, I read it in just two days – it was THAT good.The book is different in several ways, ways in which I won’t go into in my review. Suffice it to say that I’m glad I saw the movie first and then read the book. I think I might have been disappointed with the movie version if it had happened in opposite order. This just goes to show how well the author has written this important piece of fictionalized history. The time period, location, mood, characters, etc. come to life as the story unfolds.I was surprised at some of the other reviews, stating that the book was just plain depressing. I’m not at all sure how a book that deals with the systematic extinction of a race of people can be written about in an uplifting, happy way. Yet, the book is so much more than a story about a German girl who is living in Nazi Germany during WWII. There are many lovely, tender elements to be found in The Book Thief. The additional anniversary edition footnotes written by the author (at the end of the book) provide wonderful insight.I think it’s extremely important that all generations read books like The Book Thief. This is part of history and, as poet and philosopher George Santayana said, \"Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.\" This is a book that is emotionally draining, but very much worth the read!"

    "Review Text": "I waited way too long to read this book. I don't even really know why I waited so long, other than Courtney and I started this blog around the same time that I actually bought the book and it took me a while to get to the point where I started reading some of the books that I wanted to read instead of just books that we received requests for.If you follow my blog at all, you know that I love WWII era historical fiction. What I loved about this book is that it showed the lives of average Germans during the war. That's not a perspective I've seen a lot (or ever that I can think of off the top of my head). But Liesel's foster family wasn't exactly average either because they held unfavorable opinions about Jewish people, at least unfavorable by German standards during the war.Another highlight of this story was that it was told from the perspective of Death. It was a bit odd to get used to at first because he jumped around a bit, as Death is wont to do in the course of his work, but once I got used to it, it was a fun way to see things. While death isn't exactly omniscient, he does have access to information that a human narrator wouldn't have.I realize that I'm late enough to this party that you've probably already made up your mind about whether you want to read this book or not, but if you're still on the fence about it, you should absolutely not wait any longer. You're likely to regret it if you do, like I did.Overall I give The Book Thief 5.05 stars."

    "Review Title": "those haunting humans, that little girl",
    "Review Text": "With a heart full to overflowing and eyes quite moist, I finish this novel of a young waif of a girl in Hitler’s Germany whose body, soul, and spirit ought never have survived her furnace of affliction. Yet survive she does, grittily and even poetically, with the aid of a good friend, a tender father, a Jewish refugee in the basement, a mother whose harshness runs only skin keep, and a traumatized mayor’s wife who loves to have her books stolen.As the old proverb—old but still true for all its rusty years—would tell us, ‘The book is far better than the movie’. This has never been more true than with Markus Zusak’s phenomenal achievement.The book is narrated by Death, the Grim Reaper. Yet he is not an evil presence, indeed his tender observations are endearing. In the end, the circumstances of 1940s Europe keep him far busier than he’d prefer. Yet he cannot take his eyes off these dismal, glorious humans.They haunt him, these human beings do. He sees such majesty in them, and such cruelty. The circumstances that call him into hard labors allow him to peer into the human condition at its best and, simultaneously, at its best.He cannot look away from them, these horrible, beautiful, haunting beings.This reader revels in the deeply biblical substratum of this compelling novel, whether intended by its author or not.The best book I’ve read in a year. And I’m hardly alone, for this work has virtually nailed itself to the top rung of the New York Times Bestsellers List. As another old proverb might have it, 50,000,000 Elvis fans can’t be wrong.Buy it, read it, remember it when you least expect."

    "Review Title": "This book expanded both my mind and my heart",
    "Review Text": "What a strangely beautiful, wildly imaginative, and deeply moving book. The narrator is Death, who—unexpectedly—has both a sense of humor and the capacity to be moved by poignant acts of love, generosity, and courage.The story itself—told from Death's unique perspective—follows 9-year-old Leisel Meminger, the Book Thief, from the day of her baby brother's death as her mother is taking them to be cared for by foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann at the beginning of WWII. Leisel has stolen a book that someone dropped at her brother's burial, and this begins her fascination with books and words and their myriad levels of meaning.The Hubermanns are not sympathetic to Hitler. For months they hide a Jew who is trying to escape Germany and let him live in their basement. As the war progresses, the family and the town experience severe deprivation and scarcity of food, the paranoia and fear of Hitler's henchmen, and the heartaches of loved ones going off to war or becoming victims of the Allied bombing.Through it all, Leisel survives physically and spiritually, and as I came to love her, I also came to love and hate the other strong characters, some of whom loved Leisel in their own way: her foster parents, her best friend Rudy Steiner, and Max, the Jew whom she befriended.This story is filled with sadness and heartache, yet time and again, one character or another exhibits such resiliency and integrity that it took my breath away and filled me with admiration and hope.The author uses odd formatting and a funky but effective way of handling timeframes, giving you glimpses of the future without losing the momentum or power of the narrative. This book was moving and powerful. It packed quite an emotional wallop that expanded both my mind and heart."

    "Review Title": "Nazi Germany Munich, Jewish fugitives, Jesse Owens",
    "Review Text": "January 13, 2019A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of the book The Book Thief by Markus ZusakThis book was recommended to me by Chris Manion, author of God's Patient Pursuit of my Soul, who advised that I would really like this story about Nazi Germany in the 1930's through the end of World War II. I ordered this book from Amazon in the Special Anniversary Hardback edition.Markus Zusak in his writing created an interesting way to present the dialog of the narrator.  At the outset I thought it was the main protagonist Liesel Meminger narrating then it seemed to morph into another person, not clearly identified at first.  It made for an uncomfortable and challenging beginning only to learn after several appearances to be the spirit of Death.  This however did not create a feeling of horror or was it distracting once you got the hang of this unnamed narrator.  It did not take away from the overall story and the flow was rhythmic and consistent throughout the book,  The overall style was very interesting and provided the reader with a glimpse of what was to follow in the succeeding chapter.Many reviews described the book as a something a child would enjoy or relish.  I am not sure if this is accurate as the story was very mature in its concept and gave one an inside track on the happenings of Germany during the rise and fall of the Third Reich. The human protagonist is a young girl about ten years old and how she is being abandoned by her natural mother to a family living in a suburb of Munich, Germany. She is traveling with her mother and younger brother who is quite sick.  When the train stops, some distance from the final destination in Munich, the boy dies and they have to bury him in a small cemetery where the grave diggers misplace a book; The Grave Digger's Handbook  and Liesel, purloins it for no apparent reason other than a simple souvenir of remembrance of her deceased brother.  The mother deposits Liesel with the Hans and Rosa Hubermann  family, a peasant family who lived in the poorer section of town. Rosa is a seemingly strict foster mother and her husband Hans is unemployed and on disability. Hans becomes Liesel's mentor and teaches Liesel to read via the book she stole from the cemetery.  During a book burning in Munich, where Jews were being persecuted, forbidden books were cast into public bonfires and Liesel stole her second book and added to her foster father's reading curriculum. Her friend Rudy is a Tom Sawyeresque young boy who develops a love for Liesel and several fun experiences are had by both.The Hubermanns  take in an escaped Jew into their home and hide him in their basement, a very dangerous thing in Nazi Germany.  Max the Jewish fugitive becomes a second mentor to Liesel and she develops  a similar relationship as she has with Hans.During one of the book burning events, Liesel steals her third book which add to her curriculum being used by Hans and now Max. She is spotted by the Mayor's wife and consequently a covert relationship is developed by the wife of the mayor and Liesel, which results in another mentor for Liesel.The book has all the drama and sadness one would expect in a novel contemporaneous with Nazi Germany but it is a book worth reading. It has humor, love, sadness, drama, tragedy, suspense, unexpected and predicted outcomes.I have to say I loved this book and reading it became obsessive with me and I believe it demonstrated the author's great talent.  I unhesitatingly gave this book five stars and highly recommend its reading."

I could have finished the book if I didn't loathe entirely the author's writing style, but that alone made this book unfinishable.I prefer real stories of Holocaust survivors instead of fictionalized stories that put a happy face on some of the ugliest things humanity has done to itself. Gave two stars because I guess for young readers, the real stories can be too graphic and horrible. Maybe this will inspire a young reader to look for a real biography or autobiography. Adults who can handle it, please look for better reading.I recommend Five Chimneys by Olga Lengyel, the Night trilogy by Elie Wiesel (most people only read Night but Dawn and Day are equally good), and also The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank by Willy Lendwer. There are more very good biographies and autobiographies out there that are a hundred times more compelling, emotional, inspirational, and thought-provoking than this. If you prefer video, you can go on youtube and look up the Shoah Foundation and find real video interviews from survivors."

But this author--and a zillion reviewers, apparently--have no problem with references to The Jew, among other distancing, classically anti-Semitic/racist tactics. Personally, I was appalled. I don't know how this rather thin piece of drivel managed to pass all the PC tests, but to me, a Jewish American, I got through half of this book before the gall choked me. And nowadays, when anti-Semitism is on the rise, when streets cannot be named after a person named Lynch anymore (sorry, Jane), I'm beside myself when reading this handbook on Nazi tactics. It's a how-to, complete with countless negative epithets for Hitler's innocent victims. I do not want my grandchildren to read this garbage, even if it's written with some suave literary touches. No, I grew up with Europeans whose parents were brainwashed by Nazis. Do not encourage bad habits."

    "Review Text": "I had never heard of this book until last September at back to school night.  My daughter's sophomore English teacher listed the books they would be reading this school year and as he read off Kite Runner, he said \"it had one disturbing part\".  Well, that meant I needed to read it before my daughter did.I found many more than one part of it disturbing especially as a novel for teenagers.  Kite Runner is dark,  depressing, descriptive of violence and in my opinion, not a good choice for high school students.Khaled Hosseini is a talented writer but I fail to understand why high school students should be analyzing a fictional novel dramatizing so many dark topics and adult subject matter.  I thought I had read the \"one disturbing part\" in Chapter 7, homosexual rape, but Kite Runner continues with a series of painful, life altering, distressing and depressing event after event throughout the book to the very last chapter.I've never read a book with so much trauma happening to it's characters (and then I read Hosseini's other book A Thousand Splendid Suns).  Kite Runner starts with a dysfunctional family (a son who does not feel loved by his single father) and a dysfunctional \"friendship\" between boys due to their cultural cast system.  A physical birth disfigurement, cowardice, cover up lies, and betrayal are touched on. War atrocities are covered including more homosexual rape, gun violence, power struggles, and the flight of refugees.  This novel also ties in cancer, infertility, adultery, a bastard child, deception, more violence including a public stoning, innocent victims killed in broad daylight, child servitude and attempted suicide.  Many reviews mention the main character's courage to seek redemption but I found the circumstances overly dramatized and any meaningful aspects of redemption washed out.Kite Runner ends with a glimmer of hope for better times but after the countless events of trauma, violence and brutality, emotionally and physically throughout the book, the hopeful ending only makes a dull thud against the depressing, dark, adult topics depicted and graphically described throughout the book.I fail to see why Kite Runner is being selected over countless other great pieces of literature. I do not feel this book is a necessary read to understanding the complex differences of Afghanistan's culture nor it's history. I am not opposed to high school students being exposed to different cultures or adult topics but of the literary options that are available, I do not feel Kite Runner offers educational value that exceeds the depressing nature of this book and the descriptive imagery of countless depressing adult topics that have happened in Afghanistan and are probably still happening in Afghanistan.  I prefer my 15 year old to learn about Afghanistan in a neutral, historical style rather than taking an emotional ride with fictional characters.It astounds me that over 4,000 readers rate this book with 5 stars.  My question to them is how many of them would choose this book over another book for their high school students."

    "Review Text": "There are so many ways that this book has touched me; it's difficult to find a place to begin.I read this book after reading \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" because I was beginning to really become aware of how many of our fellow brothers and sisters in other places in the world have the same desires that we do in the United States: to raise our children with a sense of morality, the determination to make more of oneself, and the endurance to keep going in horrific times and situations.The narrator of this story is so breathtakingly honest that I feel that his conscience is only open to me. This story allows me to recognize that more than likely every human who has ever walked this earths has had moments of deep regret, and that if we could, we would go back and redo as we examine how life could have been different if other choices were made.Reading this book has made this far away place seem so much closer - and its people much more understandable to me. It's an emotional read but a must-read for all who, like me, have not read a book like it."

    "Review Text": "My 16 year old daughter was assigned this book to read in school. I often read my high school aged children's literature assignments but rarely have I been so riveted by one. This story is not for the faint of heart. It's down right brutal at times and the language and subject matter are such that adults should think carefully before allowing their younger teens to read. But for older and more mature teens, there are important lessons to be learned. And for a born and bred American, it's refreshing to get a middle eastern perspective on the world that is honest and thoughtful. I don't know if it's accurate to say I enjoyed reading this book but I was certainly enriched by the experience."

We’re there going for showing a caste system? Again 100 books could show this. We’re they going for a book showing the importance’s of the choices you make haunting you through your life? Heck the Christmas Carroll accomplishes this. But to have high schoolers (not even seniors) reading this with sodomization, child rape, caste segregation, mass murder"

    "Review Text": "This was a great book.  I really did enjoy it.  The story is of a wealthy boy in Kabul, Afghanistan and a servant boy at his home who become friends.  The wealthy boy pines for his father's affection (his mother died giving birth to him) but he never fully gets it (or his dad's approval).  The boys are each other's playmates until they are about 10 when something terrible happens to the servant boy.  The wealthy boy witnessed it, but ran instead of helped.  And the wealthy boy never saw the servant boy again.The wealthy boy moves to America with his father when the Taliban takes over Kabul and there he finds college, a wife, and a new life.  Until one day, he gets a call from an old family friend asking him to return to Kabul because he has to see him.  And this is where I will end my review because I do not want to give away what happens when he returns.It really was a great story.  I found myself gripping the book tightly in the end.  I wondered what had happened to the servant boy and if the wealthy boy would ever see him again.I encourage you to read this book.  There is even a movie that goes along with it!"

I have never been so simultaneously ripped apart and healed by a book. The depth of the plot and the complexities of the characters mirror a story so realistic, I had trouble believing it was fiction. I disliked the narrator, Amir, primarily because I found that his faults are similar to ones I despise in myself. As I was able to relate to him in some aspects, I felt his shame, regret, and grief but also his redemption This was not merely a book; it waa an experience."

    "Review Title": "History, imagined?",
    "Review Text": "On the one hand, if you want an idea about some snapshot in time..... biographies / semi-biographical novels are probably the best way to go. They lend character development and humanity in a way that a simple historical book never could.On the other hand..... I know that most dramatizations of things like this are something like 100% false. I have in mind Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple.\"There are several telltale signs.1. The first is that this author left when he was 12 years old, and people don't \"see\" many things at that age. His memories of the country may have been a bit.....suspect.2. The second is that there was the tried-and-true Reductio ad Hitlerum. In a country with a literacy rate less than 15% and people who thought that John Wayne was Persian, how many of them could be expected to know about Adolf Hitler? Let alone enough to find a biography in Farsi and present it as a gift.3. The \"dancing boys\" (bacha bazi) have been covered in more than one documentary about Afghanistan. As much as the author tried to use the pedophilia of the pedophiles who happened-to-be-Taliban to smear them, this tradition of dancing boys LONG predated them.Does it really make sense that there would be no pedophilia for however-long Afghanistan-existed, and then in the last few years after the Taliban took over that they would suddenly come out of the woodwork?Is it a coincidence that the antagonist was 50% German? And then, that that antagonist showed up decades later conveniently for the denouement? (Let me sum it up again, because the plausibility is so low: 1/2 blooded German who happens to be a fan of Adolf Hitler joins the Taliban and provides a biography--in Farsi-- and then he shows up for the final fight.)In a way (p.232), the author concedes that he may have had a romanticized / incomplete view of his life in Afghanistan. (Let's remember that he lived out of it more years than he lived in it, and he was 12 years old when he left.)If you talk to the few remaining black people who lived through Jim Crow in the United States, you will find that they lived in a somewhat comfortable modus vivendi with their white neighbors. It is only later authors that made the events much worse than what they likely were, even though they did not live through it. (Mildred Taylor. \"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\" Alice Walker. \"The Color Purple\")I'm not sure what reason I have to believe that it would be any different with the Hazara (i.e., they too would have found some way to live with their Pashtun neighbors)The book had a great deal of (undeveloped) potential:1. There is the rich tapestry of ethnicities that makes up Afghanistan. (Their theme was not developed; If Hosseini could have just even given us a single paragraph about each of them, we would have come away a lot richer).I found myself looking up information on Wikipedia that was not offered in the book-- and it should have been. (For instance, did you know that there are actually more Tajiks living in Afghanistan than in Tajikistan proper?)2. Could he have given us a better picture of Hazara? What does it means for the author to keep stating that Hazara cannot read. (Afghanistan has an illiteracy rate of 68%, and Hazara are only 10~12% of the country.)3. There was a cursory glance at an extremely middle Eastern culture. But Afghanis are not Arabs, nor are they Persians. Although they did follow and almost identical historical trajectory to the Persians (a relatively moderate Islamic society under a decadent government that fell and was replaced Islamic hardliners) but how were they different?Could the purpose of this book have been to humanize Muslim refugees? (We see how well that's worked out in Germany and other parts of Europe.)The book itself has a LOT of, um, feminine overtones:1. The protagonist is extremely girlish.Weeping and crying and vomiting all over the place.As an adult in the book, he does not act particularly manly about approaching his love interest. More like a love-struck junior high school girl.2. Everything is such a *big* secret. \"Big secrets\" are the backdrop of a large number of novels written for women.3. Lots of whinging about the unequal status of Afghani women. Is this something that men really think about? Especially if they're on the winning side of it.A glossary would really have been nice.Verdict: $6 and a couple of afternoons of reading time.And that's about what it was worth.It was a decent read, but won't be a re-read."

    "Review Title": "I was very intrigued and satisfied as it was a very good read",
    "Review Text": "When I picked this book up, I was very intrigued and satisfied as it was a very good read. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini details a life story of a young boy, Amir who grows up looking for redemption as a result of his betrayal to his half-brother Hassan.  Throughout the novel, Hosseini delves into the mind of Amir who, in the beginning of the novel, is a young boy living with his father and best friend/half brother in Kabul, Afghanistan. As a loyal friend, Hassan, despite being a Hazara, always defends Amir and himself against the pashtun boys for being friends despite Amir and Hassan’s difference in social stature. Soon, they split apart after Amir betrays Hassan. Feeling the consequences of his cowardice, Amir sets out to find redemption for his inaction as he goes to save Hassan’s son from the Taliban after Hassan passes. Throughout the novel, Hosseini recounts the story through the first person mind of Amir whose guilt-driven consciousness drives the plot. Hosseini weaves the idea that redemption is important because sin is enduring throughout the story. He explains that Amir seeks to help Sohrab, Hassan’s son, as he realizes that he has been “peeking into that deserted alley for the last twenty-six years.” It becomes apparent that his cowardice and betrayal towards Hassan has plagued his consciousness with guilt. Without relief, he cannot live a normal life that he had tried to build in the United States.The title of the book also reveals an important aspect of the plot as the kite fighting tournaments become essential to understanding the underlying meaning of the story. Kite fighting in the beginning of the novel represents the distinct dichotomy that was occurring at that in Afghanistan between the Pashtuns and the Hazaras, but it also represents the strong bond between the half brothers. In the end, the kite fighting represents the promising future that was ahead of Sohrab and Amir. Hosseini reveals that Amir had “looked down at Sohrab. One corner of his mouth curled up just so. A smile.” Although, he has sinned in the beginning, Amir finally finds his redemption and relief within Sohrab.Overall, this book was very captivating as it keeps readers on their toes throughout the entire story. One can feel a sort of connection with the narrator further aiding the reader the importance of redemption. I would give this book five stars."

    "Review Title": "It is an amazing book and I would recommend it to everyone",
    "Review Text": "The Kite Runner was written by Khaled Hosseini as a historical fiction novel. Khaled Hosseini was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1965. His family was granted asylum in the United States in 1980, right after the war broke out. Hosseini started writing his first book, “The Kite Runner” in 2001 and was published in 2003 which went on to become a bestseller. Hosseini also went on to write two more novels A Thousand Splendid Suns and And The Mountains Echoed. They all are based on Afghanistan and the social issues that occur throughout the country. Hosseini is still today a big part of Afghanistan and started a non-profit in which the funds are allocated to the country. The Kite Runner is a novel about a man who lives in the United States but is remembering a past experience which changed his life. He goes on explaining this event in which he and his friend when they were younger used to fly kites before the government got overthrown and they would have battles against other people in the city. Then the government gets overthrown and they are forced to move away from the city. Flash forward to when he is living in the United States, he is forced to go back to this city to pick something up, still under control of the Taliban Afghanistan is still an extremely harsh place to be. He finds what he was looking for and after some rough patches he gets back to his wife in the U.S. This story made me realize the harshness of the world and what people are faced with everyday in Afghanistan and other countries throughout the world. It is an amazing book and I would recommend it to everyone."

    "Review Title": "The Heartstrings of a Kite",
    "Review Text": "Let’s face it, when I read Khaled Hosseini’s novel “The Kite Runner”, I simply assumed I was reading historical fiction and that Amir, the main character in the book was the real author. I had to keep looking at the title page to convince myself it wasn't Amir who was writing.  If you can achieve that with fiction, I suspect that means you are doing something good.  This is certainly the case with Hosseini.  And obviously the reading public would agree based on this books success.To start at the end, this book  closes with the events of September 11, 2001, in which the downing of the World Trade Centers changed our country.  In Amir’s case, his closing remarks were about his revelation that Afghanistan has become a household name, to be discussed, of all places, in the most American of our coffee houses, Starbucks.  Over the 17 years since it first appeared on the New York Time’s best seller list, it has received major acclaim, and of course  the movie also garnered acclaim in 2008.  And many US high schools have picked it up in their 11th and 12th grade literature classes, another source of acclaim, although to some extent, any book of great controversial subject matter, stirs the pot of emotions stemming from political correctness, to religiosity, to just plain vanilla helicopter-parent-paternalism.  The world has changed, Afghanistan is on the map, and Amir, having  reconciled the demon’s of his past, is no closer to solving the problem in front of him.  Redemption is only bittersweet.At the start, in 1975 when we first meet Amir and his life changes forever, we meet those demons; and we meet Hassan, the kite runner.  Hassan  is Amir’s best friend. He is also his servant who tends to his every need.  Hassan makes his food, cleans his house, irons his clothes and is his constant companion, except in school, where Amir learns to read and write, and Hassan, of a minority group belonging to a lower societal caste, remains illiterate.  Growing up in Kabul, Afghanistan, living a life of privilege, in a society that is beginning to falter, the two boys would share their common passion for flying kites.  Amir would fly and fight the kite in competition, and Hassan would chase vanquished kites, retrieving them for their victor as a trophy, by outwitting and  running those who were also in pursuit.  Hassan became the most fabled kite runner in Kabul for his uncanny ability to predict when and where the free flying kite, string cut, would return to earth. Having made many runs through the city, as the story must, during one such run, Hassan experiences the full onslaught of racial violence one group of oppressors could subject on another group. And Amir, helpless as he believes, allows this violence to play out.  His demon’s were born.  Despite his abysmal cowardice the search for redemption compels you to read further.The road to redemption requires the telling of Amir’s story.  But in a broader sense, he is telling the recent history of Afghanistan...a truly tumultuous period of time between the fall of the Monarchy and the rise of the Taliban, interspersed with the Russian invasion which made conditions ripe for that seizure of total power in the vacuum.  Of course without the Taliban there would have been no 9/11. The US remains in Afghanistan today... although to be topical, President Trump, has just announced another reduction of troops from 4,500 down to 2,500. At the height of the conflict the United States had no less than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. This reduction of 2,000 troops today, by comparison, seems paltry and no doubt  political. Lest I head down that same path, I return to The Kite Runner.Beautifully narrated by Hosseini, having never been to Afghanistan, I feel compelled to one day travel there to see the valleys, smell the air, meet the people, and of course see kites.  It is important to note that at the height of the Taliban’s reign of terror, flying kites became  illegal.  That would be, for our country, the equivalent of banning baseball.  Can there be a more innocuous pastime than flying kites? The brutality of the regime cannot be underestimated and simply glimpsed by this erosion of simple freedom.  Let alone the long list of other requirements and indicts of Taliban law.The Kite Runner is an important book.  My daughter read it in high school and basically demanded that I read it too.  Not just to learn about life in Afghanistan, but certainly learning deeply about a different culture is a first rate education.  But more so for the story of conflict on so many levels.  Conflict of class, race, religion, politics, and for course, a conflict of the heart.  This story pulls at your heartstrings as aptly as a string moves a kite. I was moved to tears on no less than three occasions.In truth, I struggled to read this book in print form, due to Hosseini’s intentional use of cultural names and words for which I stumbled to pronounce.  Listening to the audio book, however, allowed me far easier access.  After which, when accustomed to the language, the pages were easier to read and Hosseini’s words jumped from the pages.  Four stars for this important book."

    "Review Text": "I tried to read this novel in a way I could enjoy a puzzle and it received 2 stars for this aspect. However it lost my 3 additional stars for the woeful degree of research that went into some of his writing he claims as fact.  When using actual historical events and ideas, a writer better have his or her facts straight. Mr Brown does not. Gnosticism has nothing whatsoever to do with the thinking that Jesus was merely human. Quite the opposite. Gnostics believed Jesus was more spirit than anything else.  Like a ghost who only appeared to take on human form.  The idea that Christianity removed females from the limelight is again false.  There are a number of instances that Jesus bestowed a special privilege on women, including the woman who broke the jar of perfume and put the perfume on Jesus (Jesus rebuked a disciple in that instance), and when women were the first to the tomb and witness the risen Jesus.  The idea that the temple was a place of sexual rites that God condoned is ludicrous.  Anything close to that happening is when Israel slid into idolatry.  The idea that the gnostic gospels are credible and that the Bible that we have contains myth.  If you read Luke and Acts the man who wrote those books claimed it was factual history.  The gnostic gospels have been proven over and over again to have been written at least a century or longer after the events portrayed. On the other hand the books we have are shown to have been written within the lifetime of people who witnessed the events portrayed."

    "Review Text": "I love the fact that Mr. Brown pulls on our shared global knowledge of certain works of art then expands on those with less widely know artworks that are just as amazing, I spend a good half my time looking at Google images of the works he described.He also does what many authors aspire to do, makes the world think, ponder and question what we take for granted as solid fact.  As he mentioned specifically in this book, it is the victors who write history, and how many events of all history are either skewed to favor the current ruling parties or completely rewritten to change what was the previous \"known\" history.  This makes me wonder how much truth has been lost over the centuries (too much) and just what the actual truth may be.  This book has sparked many a theological discussion as well as getting many people who never were that \"into\" art, interested in the idea that art is another form of recording our past and how art has been used throughout time to support governments, subvert governments, and tell the story of humanity.Well worth the read."

I am not enough of an authority on history or the conspiracy theories Brown mentions to be able to speak to the accuracy of the novel, but I can say that Brown expects his reader to believe coincidence and leaps of logic that even the worst thriller writers would be embarrassed to attempt to get away with. I actually stopped reading at page 244 which is exactly 50% of the way through, when Langdon wrapped a cryptex in his coat to pass it off as a baby. The story is corny to the nth degree."

    "Review Text": "It's been years since this 'The Da Vinci Code' has been out, and I'm sure everything has been said that needs to be said about it, but I would like to share my own personal story about this book.It was around 2004-2005. I was out of university and working. I was one of those Americans that didn't pick up a book after college at the time, you know, the majority of them. Maybe it was because there were no good books around, maybe I thought adult novels were too long, whatever it was, I didn't read. I don't know how I stumbled upon this book. I believe a lot of people were talking about it, a lot, so I thought, \"why not give this one a try?\"It took a couple of weeks to finish as I like to savor every word an author has written. I read it as fast as I could with each chapter ending in some breathless cliffhanger. And like an episode of television, I didn't want to binge-watch like people do these days; I read a few chapters in each sitting waiting in anticipation for the next day to read more. I don't want to say anything about the topic of the book as I went in completely blind and ended up wonderfully surprised and immensely enjoyed it, and I would want the same for you. (An aside: I grew up Christian, but ended up being an Atheist). I do think an open mind, and some light background knowledge of Christianity will help in truly enjoying this book.I've never read a book like this, if ever, at the time. It was thrilling, it was well-researched, it made me think this could almost be real. It is the definition of a must-read. That's all that should be said about this book. But what I would like to say is that this book was the spark that restarted my love for reading that I had as a kid. I read a lot as a kid, but sometimes we are forced to read things, and kids do not like being forced to do things (parents, that's a lesson for you). The forcing of reading could be a reason I was turned off of books for a few years, but if there was ever a book to get you started again, this is, *the book*.Now, about Dan Brown's ability to write, I've read what others have said about his writing style, and I don't agree with them for this book. I wasn't conscious about it for 'The Da Vinci Code', but I can see and understand other people's perspective on it. However, if you've read one of his books, you've read them all. Dan Brown's books are like James Bond films, they all follow a formula with similar ingredients, but we still keep watching them because the formula works. I do recommend his other books starring Robert Langdon ('\n\nAngels & Demons\n\n  ', '\n\nInferno\n\n  ', *NOT* '\n\nThe Lost Symbol\n\n  '—that was a snoozer).Pick The Da Vinci Code up, borrow it, get the illustrated version (it's the best version) [see photos], but read this book if you haven't already. It's significantly better than the film, and I think you will enjoy it as most of the world has. Recommended!"

Asleep in his hotel suite, he receives a call from the front desk informing him an officer of the French police, is trying to reach him. After putting the officer off, he gets another call from the front desk informing him the police are sending someone to take him to the superior officer. And thus starts a deepening mystery, fraught with clues and intrigue, that takes the reader on a series of twists and turns, and murder after murder.

    "Review Text": "My son recently read To Kill a Mockingbird for school so I decided to reread it. This time around, I listened to the audiobook, which is read by Sissy Spacek. The book is narrated in first person from Scout’s point of view and Spacek’s soft, natural Southern voice is perfect for it.I always struggle writing an actual review for a classic novel because it’s usually been reviewed and analyzed to death. I’m going to tell you my thoughts anyway! Like I said, To Kill a Mockingbird is written from the first person point of view of Scout Finch, who is around six years old when the story begins. She lives in Maycomb, Alabama with her father Atticus and her brother Jem. Atticus is a lawyer and is the most respected man in town. When Tom Robinson, a black man, is falsely accused of raping a white woman, the town’s judge appoints Atticus to defend him. The chances that Tom will be acquitted are slimmer than slim but as Atticus says, real courage is, “when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.” That’s why the judge appointed him. He knew that Atticus was the only lawyer who would give his all to defending Tom even though it was a lost cause. Meanwhile, Scout, Jem and their friend Dill are obsessed with the Finch’s mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. They delight in daring each other to get close to the Radley house.To Kill a Mockingbird is full of life lessons. Atticus is pretty much the perfect human and the wisdom he imparts to Scout and Jem is profound. I liked how Harper Lee took her time building up to the actual trial. She shows us years of life in Maycomb so that the reader can truly understand the South in the 1930s. There is a rich cast of supporting characters, all vividly drawn. It’s tragic to realize that not all that much has changed in how our country treats black people since the time of this book. Black people are still treated unfairly by the criminal justice system quite often, resulting in America’s huge mass incarceration problem.I’m so glad I reread To Kill a Mockingbird. I had forgotten just how much I loved it. There is so much about it that is timeless and Atticus’s lessons still resonate today. If by chance you haven’t read this book, I highly recommend that you do."

She also learns that everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and to receive justice, no matter what their skin color.I first read TKAM in high school 50 years ago. I re-read it, as I'm sure many others have, in preparation for reading the recently published  \"To Set a Watchman\".  I was touched deeply by this story in 1967. And I'm touched just as deeply in 2017.  Harper Lee made us stare prejudice and injustice in the face, and made us want to aspire to be an Atticus Finch.  A flag-waving 5 stars!"

    "Review Text": "‘You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.’Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird is an undisputed classic that few will avoid having read in their lifetime, and those few are to be pitied. As I habe presentation of the novel coming up this weekend, a discussion group that I am lucky enough to be allowed to lead as part of the The Big Read here in Holland, Michigan, I felt it necessary to revisit this timeless classic (and I figured I’d review it to help collect my thoughts on the subject). The experience was like returning to a childhood home and finding it warm and welcoming and undisturbed from the passage of time, like walking the streets of my old neighborhood and hearing the calls of friends as they rode out with their bikes to greet me, of knowing the mailman by name and knowing where all the best places for hide-and-seek were, the best trees to climb, and feeling safe and secure in a place that is forever a part of yourself. Though some of the mechanics of the novel seemed less astonishing than my first visit more than a decade ago, the power and glory was still there, and I found a renewed love and respect for characters like Atticus, whom I’ve always kept close to heart when wrestling with my own position as a father. Harper Lee created a wonderful work that incorporated a wide range of potent themes, wrapping class systems, gender roles, Southern manners and taboos, and an important moral message of kindness, love and conviction all within a whimsical bildungsroman that no reader who has been graced by its pages will ever forget.‘The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.’Before dipping into the novel itself, I’d like to take a moment to speak about Atticus Finch, one of my favorite characters in all of Literature. Atticus is a pillar of morality, a man of honor, integrity, and most importantly, conviction. He is humble and honest, even admitting to his children that yes, indeed they are poor. In a novel about society, with its tumultuous mess of morals and class, Atticus is like an authorial deus ex machina, being Lee’s method of inserting moralizing and an example of what constitutes a ‘good man’ into the book through character and not authorial asides. I’ve always idolized Atticus and tried to think ‘what would Atticus do?’ when it come to being a father and undertaking difficult moral conundrums (I even named my second cat Catticus Finch). Atticus takes the unpopular position of defending a black man in a rape case when assigned to him despite the town nearly ostracizing him. Atticus does his duty, and does it well, as a man of conviction that believes in doing what is right and honorable regardless of the consequences, living up to his statement that ‘Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what’. In fact, Lee originally intended to name the novel Atticus before deciding it would stifle the broad perspective of Macomb by drawing too much attention to one character. Atticus remains steadfast throughout the novel, sure of himself and fully developed, whereas those around him undergo more a sense of change and development. This is a novel about personal growth and a broader understanding of those around you, and Atticus is the anchor to integrity and morality keeping his children centered in the violent storm of emotions and violence that befalls Macomb.‘When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness sake. But don't make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion faster than adults, and evasion simply muddles 'em.’There is a childlike innocence spun through a novel of such weight and seriousness, executed brilliantly by Lee’s choice of Scout as the narrator. We are forever seeing a larger world through the eyes of a young girl still trying to find her place in it while making sense of all the hustle and bustle around her, and this creates an incredible ironic effect where there are large events going on that the reader understands but are delivered nearly through defamiliarization because the narrator cannot fully grasp them¹. The narration allows Lee to balance the coming-of-age hallmarks with the weightier themes, allowing the reader to maintain an innocence from the rape and racism while still able to make sense of the society functioning at large, and retreating from the darker themes into the fun of the children’s comings and goings. What is most impressive is how everything blends together, and the lessons learned in each aspect of their life are applied to all the other elements they come in contact with. The fates of Tom and Boo Radley are emotionally and morally linked in the readers mind, heart and soul.All the standard bildungsroman motifs that make people love the genre are present in To Kill a Mockingbird, from schoolyard quarrels, to learning your place in society. We see Scout, Jem, and even Dill, gain a greater understanding of the world and their place in it, watch the children come to respect their father for more than just being a good father, see them make dares, terrorize the neighbors in good fun, and even stop a mob before it turns violent. With Scout, particularly, there is an element of gender identity at play that leads into a larger discussion about class and society. Children learn from those around them, and Scout spends much of the novel assessing those around her, perhaps subconsciously looking for a role model for herself. The ideas of what a good southern woman is and should be are imposed upon her throughout the town, such as Ms Dubose who criticizes her manner of dress, or Aunt Alexandra and her attempts to eradicate Scout’s tomboyish behavior, and she learns to dislike Miss Stephanie and her gossipy behavior. Miss Maudie, however, curbs gossip and insults, and puts on the face of a southern lady, but still gets down into the dirt in the garden and behaves in other, more boyish, ways that Scout identifies with. The gender identification becomes a cog in the gear of Southern tradition in manners and class. While the court case is unquestionably controversial due to the racial implications, it is also because it forces people to discuss rape and involves questioning the Word of a woman. It forces up a lot of taboo that the community is uncomfortable in being forced to deal with it, and many inevitably turn a squeamish blind eye when forced to confront the ugly truths at hand. Macomb is a society where everything and everyone has their place, a set identification, and they do not like it being disturbed. Most important to note is the correlation that the characters who are most inclined to uphold societal traditions through self-righteous brow-beatings often exhibit the most rampant racism throughout the novel.‘Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.’There are many ‘mockingbird’ characters in this novel, such as Tom and Boo, but the real mockingbird is, to me at least, the innocence that is lost. The town is forced to see each other for who they really are, to question their beliefs, to grow up with all the racism and bigotry going on around them. Atticus teaches Scout that we cannot know someone until ‘you consider things from his point of view’, and through the novel we see many misjudgements of character based on misunderstanding or characters refusing to see beyond their closed opinions, or even something as simple as Scout and Jem believing the rumors of Boo Radley as a bloodthirsty maniac. ‘People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.’ This applies to many obdurate aspects of society, such as Miss Maudie stating ‘sometimes the Bible in hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of-oh, your father,’ emphasizing the ways that a closed mind is just as dangerous as a violent hand and that even religion can be misused. There is a message of love, of looking into the hearts of others and not just judging them, a message of compassion and open-mindedness working through To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is a message that we all must be reminded of from time to time.There are a few issues that arose on a re-reading of the novel, having grown myself as a reader since I first encountered this lovely book. While the moral lessons are important and timeless, there is a sense of heavy-handedness to their delivery. Particularly at the end when Sheriff Tate points out the dangers of making a hero of Boo Radley.taking the one man who’s done you and this town a great service an’ draggin’ him with his shy ways into the limelight—to me, that’s a sin. It’s a sin and I’m not about to have it on my head.This statement is quickly followed by Scout mentioning to Atticus that ‘Well, it’d be sort of like shootin’ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?’. It seems a bit unnecessary to reiterate the point, especially when Tate’s double use of sin was enough to draw a parallel to the message earlier in the novel that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This, I admit, is overly nitpicky but brings up a conversation about teaching this novel in schools. This book is, ideally, read at a time of the readers own coming-of-age and the connections they are sure to draw with the characters reinforce the love for the novel. It is also a time in life when you are just beginning to understand the greater worlds of literature, and overtly pointing out themes is more necessary for readers when they haven’t yet learned how to look for them properly. It is books such as this that teach us about books, and usher us into a world of reading between the lines that we hadn’t known was there before. Another quiet complaint I have with the novel that, despite the themes of racism, Calpurnia seems to be a bit of an Uncle Tom character. However, who wouldn’t want to be in service for as great of a man as Atticus, so this too can be overlooked.To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel surely deserving of it’s classic status. Though it is not without its flaws, there is a timeless message of love that permeates through the novel. It is also of great importance as a book that young readers can use as a ladder towards higher literature than they had been previously exposed to. Lee has such a fluid prose that makes for excellent storytelling, especially through the coming-of-age narrative of Scout, and has a knack for creating exquisite characters that have left their immortal mark in the halls of Literature as well as the hearts of her readers.4.5/5‘...when they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things...Atticus, he was real nice.Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.’¹This style is reminiscent of William Faulkner, such as the court scene in Barn Burning from the detached perspective of a child. In fact, much of this novel feels indebted to Faulkner and the works of Southern Gothic authors before her, and the Tom incident and case feels familiar to those familiar with Faulkner’s Dry September or Intruder in the Dust. The way the most self-righteous and self-professed 'holy' also tend to be the basest of character morals is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor as well. Lee’s story is fully her own, but it is always interesting to see the travels and growth of literary tradition."

It’s a rare gift to write a series of everyday moments without once sounding tedious or boring.“Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy.

    "Review Text": "Recently voted the #1 best loved novel in PBS’s The Great American Read, deservedly, Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the most critically acclaimed novels of all time, winning the Pulitzer Prize even while it was still on the best seller lists.  Ten years after its publication, High Schools like mine where installing it into their regular curriculum, and librarians across the country were voting it one of the best and most inspirational novels of American literature of all time.To Kill a Mockingbird led The Great American Read voting from the first week, and kept the lead for the entire five months of voting, despite strong competition from the other our five finalists, one of which (Lord Of The Rings) I personally voted for every day, but Mockingbird certainly deserves the win.  As with many voters and critics, I wholeheartedly believe To Kill A Mockingbird is “The Great American Novel”.As with many of my generation I discovered the novel 10 years after its initial publication as a high school student, reacquainted myself with it in college, and it was my main understanding of life in the deep south represented more realistically than other tomes like Gone With The Wind.  And while the film adaptation starring Gregory Peck is a work of art in itself, both the triple Academy Award winning film and the Pulitzer winning novel can and should be appreciated as independent works as well as fully complimentary ones.  If you have seen the film and never read the novel, please fulfill your artistic self by reading this moving and engrossing work.A further wonderful experience can be had by enjoying the recent discovery of Go Set A Watchman by Lee, an interesting entrée to the masterpiece."

    "Review Text": "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper lee is an amazing novel. This book is through the eyes of a young child named jean-louise/scout finch who is a very big tomboy. This book is very good and you end up getting very fond of the characters it almost seems that your growing up with them. As you may know this book is a classic, reading it now the only thing that bothers me is the grammar and the language but in the end i love this book. I highly recommend it for anyone 13 or older because it can be inappropriate sometimes but it's a classic for a reason. This book is very fun to read and see the life of the 1930s. Scout and her older brother Jem grow up in different ways and later in the book jem starts discluding scout from the games he does. In this book you can see how racist people were and how much the world has changed.  To kill a mockingbird is about racism and some slavery as well this book really gets it’s thought across of how unfair life was during the early 1900’s. Scout also gets to experience school and how strict they were back than to the point where she was hit with a ruler. Scout growing up realizes that life isn't always perfect like it was when she was younger. This book has wide examples of racism and it's very hard to read about it seeing the world now but to me that's just one con of many pros.  I believe the themes to To kill a mockingbird are racial injustice. There are some serious problems including racial injustice and rape. [SPOILER] in this book there is a trail about a black man named Tom robinson accused for rape even with no proof and him stating what actually happened he still was considered guilty. I believe this book could also be considered a mystery because in the book the kids including Jem, Scout, and their friend DIll harris are trying to find out what Boo radley looks like, boo radley was a convict for murder and was in house arrested and the kids always tried to get him to come out of the house. This book can be a mystery and other ways as well, In the book scout one day walking home from school saw a few treats hidden in a tree she kept coming back to the tree seeing all these treats and stealing them, she always wondered who put them there though. In the end I believe that this book deserves it's tittle of being a classic. This book may have a slow start until it becomes interesting but after that it is just a all around great book. I really believe that seeing two sibling who very much acted the same and were very close grow up and become more protective of each other and different in their own ways, I quickly realized how engaging this book is the more you read of it and that's why I believe this is a very good novel."

I found this novel to be a worthwhile repeat journey with narrator Jean Louise (Scout) as she and her brother, Jem, grapple with some of the deepest and most troubling complexities of adulthood, including prejudice, justice (or lack thereof), and hypocrisy. These youngsters, along with friend Dill and several interesting adult characters, remind me of several important and timeless truths:that you never really know a person until you you’ve trod in their shoes,that gossip and assumptions about others are insidious,that feelings about injustice are valuable and worth attending to,and that prejudice is folly, while discernment is not."

    "Review Text": "The book starts with a school Principal announcing that a teenager has killed himself.  Later on, the main character accidentally walks in on his sister having sex.  Then we find out that she's pregnant, and she is going to get an abortion. Also, in the book there is a rape scene, and the main character describes it as it happens. The book is full of foul language. The characters discuss drugs and drinking. The cover has a quote from USA Today describing it as a \"coming of age novel.\"  I am fifteen and don't think having an abortion should be considered a normal coming of age activity.  It should be discussed and talked about as a problem. This book makes it seem that rape and abortion are normal when they shouldn't be!  It's repulsive and depressing."

    "Review Title": "The worst \"great book\" I've read in a very long time",
    "Review Text": "First of all, I respect any opinion that this is a great book. But I must say I am confounded by the thousands of five-star reviews, because not only do I not see that, but I actively, aggressively disliked \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" which would have been more aptly titled \"The Perks of Being Weird and Weepy.\"I was not put off or bothered by the sex, drinking, drugs, language or some of the other things which seemed to have burned some readers' eyes (although I will add that anyone who really believes these are not elements regularly encountered in the life of the average high school student has probably not been to high school since the days of one-room schoolhouses). My criticisms mostly have to do with the characterizations, almost exclusively centered on our main character and narrator, Charlie.Charlie is a character who had a lot of possibilities, all mostly missed. He waffles between well-beyond-high-school profundity and confounding childishness. One minute he's pondering the meaning of life (with some real intuitiveness, sometimes) and the next he's wrapped up in some kind of nauseatingly twee description of something (\"Do you know what a Secret Santa is?\") And who, pray, is the \"friend\" on the other end of these letter entries? This \"friend\" whose persona would seem to have had enough rotations around the sun to know about sex, LSD, pot, heroin, etc., but has never heard of a Secret Santa or masturbation? Is this like the \"Kitty\" of Anne Frank's diary, or is this a real person? We never know, and the \"Dear Friend\" salutations and the \"Love Always\" closings quickly become tiresome, when at the outset the diary/letter approach seemed like a cool idea.As other reviewers have asked, *is* Charlie meant to have some intellectual disability, or isn't he? In reading, it almost made me angry that I wasn't given enough evidence to form a conclusion, because that may or may not have formed my conclusions of the character -- or at the very least made me more forgiving of the way this character is drawn.Worst of all, the crying! Charlie tells us \"I started crying\" so many times I lost count. The crying aside (if you can put it aside -- I really can't), it is impossible to tell whether the rudimentary descriptions of Charlie's feelings are devices on the part of the author, or are just egregious examples of a breaking with \"show, don't tell.\" (\"I wanted to be happy it was my birthday, but I felt upset.\" \"...but I felt sad.\" \"I was getting really upset.\") It is simply not believable that the same character who is capable of a critical reading of \"The Fountainhead\" describes himself and his feelings as if he had just made a guest appearance on \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.\" The result of all this messiness is a character that I not only didn't understand or sympathize with, but aggressively loathed.It is also simply not believable that the group of \"cool fringe kids,\" none of whom has a lot going for them either, depth-wise, would have the time of day for this sappy weirdo. By the time it was finally revealed that Charlie's past held a potential explanation for some of his feelings and behavior, I simply didn't care. I haven't disliked a central character this much in a long time, but the problem is I don't think the author intended him to be unlikable.So, \"Dear Friend,\" to each his own, but it's not my own!"

I am absolutely MORTIFIED that any teacher (which I am one!) would EVER assign this book to students. In Part One alone, there are multiple vivid descriptions of teenagers having sex. I’m not living in a fantasy world about what some teenagers do, but reading this kind of trash is only toxic to kids who desperately are searching for identity and purpose in this harsh world.

I think my biggest concern that I cannot seem to get over the fact that this kid has been abused and then witnesses another abuse without intervening.  Maybe the draw is for those who have been through similar situations.  I just can't relate.  It also disturbs me that Charlie seems to send such personal information to what appears to be a complete stranger.  I am glad that he found a friend in his teacher, who suggested he read many books--several of which I would now also like to read.That being said, I see no \"perks\" to \"being a wallflower\" at all.  The kid is abused and allows/watches things happen to himself and others.  I think the only attraction to this book must be to be a voyeur into a messed-up teenage boy's life.The young man who recommended I read this book had a similar life, so I can understand why he related and loved it so much.  My heart goes out to him and the author, who probably also lived through a similar situation."

    "Review Text": "The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a truly moving story about Charlie, a freshman in high school, who is by no means popular. He is very shy, but that all comes down to a mental issue that occurred because of something that happened when he was younger, which you will get the gist of later on in the book. The author, Stephen Chbosky, has plotted this story very well. It isn't your average book set up - Charlie writes letters to an anonymous reader known as 'Friend'. Charlie tells this person everything he does and feels, who he meets and loves. Charlie meets two outgoing outsiders that are much cooler than him, but they accept him and he finally feels included. Patrick, a gay, happy and outgoing teen, and Sam, a beautiful young woman, introduce Charlie to a new world filled with sex, drugs and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. They also show Charlie the power of music and Charlie becomes more and more music savvy. He particularly likes The Smiths and the song ‘Asleep’. Charlie goes on a rollercoaster ride full of emotions, and learns that he has the greatest friends he could wish for. If you read this story you will laugh, cry and keep reading on. It is not to be missed. Charlie will show you that high school can be enjoyed if you have the right friends and becoming a teenager isn't as scary as you think, even though it seems that way. Although, I could not relate to any of the characters in the book, it was interesting to learn about what other people might be going through. This book really opened my eyes, and made me realize that people might seem fine on the outside, but there are often bigger things going on in their lives. Charlie's story touched me, because I feel like many authors don't like to talk about the things that Charlie went through as a kid. It was a refreshingly new way of writing. I would most definitely recommend this book to a friend because I think that everyone would enjoy reading this book. If I could change something about this book, I wouldn’t change anything. Although some parts were sad, I think that the book wouldn't be half as good if anything was changed in it.  All in all, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an easy and fun read, and I highly recommend picking it up."

    "Review Text": "The protagonist tells the story via letter he (Charlie) is writing to someone but we don’t know who. He starts his letter off with the date and Dear Friend. He explains in his first letter why he’s writing the letters but doesn’t give a clue as to who the person is. Even at the end of the book we don’t know how the person is he’s writing to, but it doesn’t matter. By the mere fact that he starts each letter with Dear Friend we become that person he is confiding in, and that’s what he’s doing in each of these letters, confiding in us.We follow Charlie through a year of school (freshman year when we meet Charlie). He introduces us to his friends Patrick, Sam (Patrick’s sister), Bill (Charlie’s English teacher who thinks the world of Charlie), Charlie’s sister, brother and parents and those he comes in contact with. We learn secrets of these people, things that happen to them that only Charlie can share with us and things that happen to Charlie that he can only share with us. There are somethings he won’t tell us, which is fine-Patrick (high school senior) is gay and having a secret affair with Brad, the star quarterback of the school-Charlie’s sister (high school senior) gets pregnant and has an abortionCharlie has a crush on Sam (but you’ll have to read the book to find out what happens with those two)-Charlie takes LSD, has taken up smoking cigarettes and weed and drinks at times-Charlie gets a girlfriend and loses that girlfriend and his friends in the process (you have to read the book to understand it more)We learn how dysfunctional Charlie’s family is but not in a disturbing way. More in a normal dysfunctional way, where the sister hates the brother at times. Father ignores the son at times. No likes Charlie at times. But mostly, we grow to like Charlie right away and hope for the best for him.Although Charlie is a wallflower by nature, he still remains a wallflower in his own way throughout the book when he’s with his friends at parties or at Big Boy. He becomes part of the party while still sitting on the sidelines. He is apart of the many conversations while still sitting on the sidelines. Not physically of course. His letters are detailed that it’s like he was watching everything go down as well be apart of everything.Charlie has a way of staying positive throughout the letters even when things are going really wrong for him, because he has us to talk to. These letters are a way for him to remain sane through it all the best he can.Perks reminds me of my high school days and how simple things really were then. Charlie begins realizes this too through the book.There were some things I didn’t understand since the book is written between 1991 and 1992. For instance, the time Charlie comes home to find his sister watching Gomer Pyle. Gomer Pyle was in the 70’s. The author fails to tell us if the sister is watching via TVLand or another station that plays old shows. Doesn’t it matter? Yeah, it does to me, but then again, I’m probably being too particular. Charlies bring up VHS tapes, but I had remember this was the early 90’s and that’s what we had then. He talks about writing letters; again, the 90’s and email was not known or used widely then.I don’t find the 90’s as being that long ago and reading this book really made me realize how primitive (compared to today’s standards) we were. In essence, pen and paper were the tools of the day. Not Facebook, not emails, not Twitter, but pen and paper. There is a point in the book that Charlie is given a typewriter by Sam..a typewriter. Again, it’s the time period. I still think typewriters are great.Some have Said that Charlie is this generation’s Holden Caulfield from Catcher In The Rye and I strongly disagree. Holden was a rebel from the beginning; Charlie was a loaner and never did become a rebel in my opinion.This book will resonate with anyone of any age and I feel it will become a favorite among those that are teenagers now when they get older, like Judy Blume books are with us adults now."

    "Review Text": "Loved it. Like \"the fault in our stars\" I tore through this one in 2 days. This is a book that will take you through the american high school growing up experience. It doesn't attempt to avoid any part of it, which is why it is often found on banned book lists at schools. I think it is easy to see why (though the author is apparently surprised). There is drug use, there is sexual stuff, some violence. Having said that, I don't think it is a book that emphasizes any of it, but simply acknowledges: these things are a part of the culture.I really appreciate that this book does not overhype any part of life. It is not trying to sell you anything and that is so refreshing.The story is set up as a character named charlie writing letters to a more mature person he has never met, a person who \"listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with people just because you could have.\" Someone describes charlie as being a \"wallflower\" --a person who observes things and doesn't participate. He tries and begins to participate a bit more often. He finds a group of friends that is something like the 90's equivalent of the modern \"hipster\" crowd, who likes to listen to music, read books, is not inclined towards pop culture, experiments with some drugs and alcohol.This book is full of observations on the american culture from a wallflower perspective- someone who is in it, but observing it as much as participating in it. In retrospect it is beautiful for taking a calm look at it, not worried, but seeing what is there.This book would be most valuable to the adolescents who are going through, and about to go through the experiences described. They will know that there are many parts that are socially constructed and they should know it is all a phase and to feel confident in who they are, there is more to life than what you experience as an adolescent. Experience that time, don't miss it, but be yourself, even if there is no immediate popularity, you will be fine.Some parents would feel nervous about some of the topics in the book. But to be honest, that is life. I'm reminded of a certain man from Galilee who was eventually killed saying \"don't worry about your life\" and a certain hobbit from the shire saying \"it's dangerous business to walk out your front door\" ... it is. There are great experiences and ones that hurt and are sad. That's life. This book is a snapshot of life. If I continue to work with this age group, I will often recommend it."

    "Review Text": "This is a beautiful and realistic book about Charlie and his experience in his first year of high school. Everybody who is angry and talking about how it’s “inappropriate” or “gives too much detail” is just sensitive, immature, and clearly missed the entire point of the book. If it makes rape, drugs, and abortion seem like a normal thing is because, sadly, they are every day matters that our society faces. In fact, it would be wrong NOT to talk about them more openly. Again, not because they are okay, but because they are every day issues and we can’t keep hiding them! And if you’re upset about that, you must be the type of person to not report abuse, or you should just be glad that you’ve never been through any of these.Not only does it focus on physical abuse, but also emotional, and brings attention to the effects of trauma by giving the reader the perspective of someone who suffers from it.Frankly, nobody cares if you think this book is trash because it talks about sexual abuse, teens using drugs, having sex, or a teenager repeating that he felt upset and crying, and all that says about you is that you lack sympathy and the ability to truly comprehend what you are reading. All you did was indignantly focus on, judge, and cry about what you were too sensitive to read and complain that it shouldn’t have been written."

    "Review Text": "Imagine a lottery. It’s sort of like a draft lottery they had during the Viet Nam War. It’s sort of like the lottery in Shirley Jackson’s short story where the winner is stoned to death. There are two “winners” in this Hunger Games lottery, a girl and a boy. Actually they are selected - drafted. Their names are pulled out at random. They get to compete with eleven  other boys and eleven other girls in a war- games-type arena.  There can only be one winner in the Hunger Games - the person still alive at the end of the games. We follow Katniss, a girl from District Twelve, the poorest district, and Peeta, the baker’s son, from the same district. Peeta has had a crush on Katniss  since she was five years old. She owes him for giving her bread when her family was starving. She feels she should repay this debt. Now they might be forced to kill each other. The pageantry leading up to the games at times resembles a beauty contest, at times resembles training for participation in a less-lethal sport and at times it resembles preparation for a bullfight. This is a terrifying story, but it’s also a life enhancing a story as the 24 children (ages 12 to 18) in the games  sometimes form alliances based on friendship or need. It’s hard to trust anyone knowing that person might soon become your killer. There’s are lessons in survival here. There’s also romance as  Katniss isn’t sure if she loves Peeta, but she cares for him enough to fight for his survival as well as her own."

    "Review Title": "The book that started it all!",
    "Review Text": "Rating: 4.5/5.0It seems I am the last one who read this book! LOL. Lots of hype generated about this book back when it was released. For no reason I never picked it up and always delayed watching the movies so I can read the book first. I guess now it is time to watch the movie. First thing I have to say the hype is not just a hype without any justification to it. The book is very well written. The story is very fast paced and enjoyable. I know many new dystopian books took an idea or two from this one.The only drawback I would say is that we did not get to know some of the other characters who participated in the Hunger Games, some characters were more interesting than others because they were more elaborated. Rue for example was a good defined character. It would have been nice to know more about foxface. The main characters were very well written. Have no complaints about them.The end of the story will make you want to jump into the sequel right away. I think this is a good book series to invest some time into. I hope book two and three will be as good too."

    "Review Title": "A series that stands up well after 10 years",
    "Review Text": "The Hunger Games stands up wonderfully even a decade after publication and I loved it just as much this time around as I did the first time I read it.After a failed uprising 74 years ago the nation of Panem began hosting the annual Hunger Games, a tournament where two tributes from each of the twelve districts fight to the death until only one victor remains. Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen has always dreaded reaping day, but after her twelve year old sister is chosen, Katniss doesn't hesitate to volunteer to take her place. Katniss is then swept off to the glitz and glamour of the Capitol where the games take place and it will take everything she has to survive.Katniss is such a fantastic main character and I love how realistic her reactions are. Every time I read the scene where she volunteers to take Prim's place, I can feel her desperation to save her sister. It's immediately clear that the most important thing for Katniss is that she survive the games. Every decision she makes is to ensure that happens and she can return to her sister. What throws a bit of a wrench in her plans though is fellow district twelve tribute Peeta. Peeta slowly gets behind Katniss' defenses and I love the scenes between the two.I always forget just how brutal the games themselves are. The author really doesn't hold back with the violence and I find all of the traps made by the Gamemakers to be fascinating. The Gamemakers definitely come up with some crazy stuff and I really like how far they take things as it definitely ramps up the suspense. Possibly my favorite scene in the entire book is the final scene with Katniss and Rue. It's so fantastically done and Katniss' devastation is so clear. The ending of this book is amazing and I love how well it sets up for the second book in the series.Overall The Hunger Games is one of my favorite books and I'm glad I decided to reread the series."

    "Review Text": "Hi thank you for taking the time to read my review!My Rating: 5.1/5 (I know its more than posible but I just love it so much!)As a person passionate about reading, I know its hard to find a compelling book to read but this book nails it! Suzanne Collins makes me grip on to every word. Here is my summary (of the beggining so I wont say the whole book) of this.  The Country of Panem is made up of 12 districts and  a bustling Capitol and 74 years ago a rebellion against the Capitol made the goverment create the Hunger Games. A yearly event where each of the districts submit one girl and boy to go to the Capitol and fight in an arena to the death untl one victor survives.  It is reaping day and Katniss Everdeen dreads this day all year, she lives in the Seam of District 12, the lowliest district. And hunts with her friend and hunting partner Gale Hawthorne. When Katniss's beloved sister is reaped she doesn't hesitate to volenteer. So Katniss and fellow tribute Petta Mellark's lives have changed now and theres no turning back because in the Hunger Games its life or death.So go read this book!Thank you for reading! I hope you found this review helful!Bye!"

    "Review Text": "This story grabs you instantly and keeps you intrigued the entire time. I love how Collins artful writing makes you love the characters instantly. Katniss's great care for her younger sister Prim and even her tolerance of their cat gives her so much depth within the first few pages. I saw the movie first, but this book gives you so much more insight into the characters. (And, I can understand why they made a movie from the book!)The only thing that bugs me is when a story leaves you hanging because they want you to buy the next book... But, it is good marketing (and I'm a marketer, so I can't fault it too much). Definitely recommend!"

    "Review Title": "Fascinating",
    "Review Text": "The book, The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins is one of the most engaging novels I have ever set my hands upon. This book was a great choice because it offers suspense, action, romance, and drama all while maintaining a strong centralized theme and storyline. I read the book long after I watched the movie, and after recently rewatching the movie, I can say that the book was much better. It surpassed my expectations with its futuristic setting and dynamic characters. It was also really easy for me to connect with it because the main character is around the same age as me and we shared many thoughts and opinions about everyday life, even though it takes place in a futuristic dystopian society.The author follows a strong theme throughout the novel that deals with trust, loyalty, but if you look deeper than that, it is also a very dark and mature concept. The book is about a dystopian society that holds a yearly event called, “The Hunger Games”. In this even, 2 teenagers are chosen to represent each of 12 districts in a massive battle royal. This book has a lot of deep themes, including ideas of a feudal society, with each district working more labor intensive jobs as they get farther away from the capitol. It also shows the cruelness of society, and Collins’s point of view on this generation’s youth and how they are constantly fighting to find a spot in this world.This book would be great for any high school student who is looking for some thrills, drama, and a little bit of romance. People who are intrigued by the future should look into this book, as it has a lot of futuristic ideas about government and society that would interest the reader. This book is of the action genre, so the reader should expect intense scenes and some graphic moments. Younger audiences would most likely be overwhelmed by this book and would not understand the deeper meanings expressed through Collins’s writing."

    "Review Title": "An Awe Inspiring Cruelty, Heartbreaking Story that Must be Read",
    "Review Text": "I finally got around to reading this book and due to the popularity, I knew how it began. It seems that so many books are going to the theme of a nation divided into districts and this book does as well.Underneath all the fighting for survival is a boy in love with a girl and a girl who is desperate to return home. Willing to do anything, she goes along with the idea of them being in love, hoping that in the end, it will mean both will end up back in their district.The imagery invoked a lot of breathtaking pictures. The characters had enough background that I found myself loving, hating, being indifferent, or hoping that nothing bad befell them. The emotions were sharp and cut deep in many cases; the fact that the nation forced children to fight to live as punishment for a long ago war, I found horrid. Yet, in some cases, I have to admit that I was glad when some were taken out.There are a lot of twists and turns that occur. Some you see coming, some you are told are coming even if what will happen isn't known and still others that come from seemingly no where. How each character reacts helps define their personality and chance of survival. This is a book with very few places were things become dull."

    "Review Text": "Great book.  I could not put it down.  You will get very attached to the characters and involved in the story line.  I almost wanted to read the series again when I finished the last book.  Definitely worth the time, even if you have seen the movies already.The books go into so much detail developing the characters that you get personally attached to them.  Each one has their own quirks and oddities that make you fall in love with them.  You honestly feel like they are friends.  There is just the right amount of comic relief mixed in with the darker parts of the story line to keep you from getting really angry at the situations in the book, but nowhere near enough to even be slightly cheesy.  And the descriptions of the people and places are so well written, you easily come up with a mental picture of the whole story.  This book sucks you in right from the beginning and won't let you back out.  There were nights I literally stayed up until 4am to find out what happened next."

    "Review Text": "Kurt Vonnegut wrote that storytelling is \"to lie, but to keep the arithmetic straight.\" The arithmetic is not straight in this story. The improbable mathematics were too big a distraction for me. I am willing enough to believe six impossible things before breakfast, but in this book, it was beyond my capacity to do so."

    "Review Title": "Unengaging and Unoriginal, Bought for a Class",
    "Review Text": "The narrator sounded like she was reading for a children's book and made the characters voices silly... the plot was uninteresting and unoriginal, the weird love triangle doesn't do anything to move the plot at all, completely unnecessary tween drama. Never felt like the main character was ever in any real danger because she gets coincidentally lucky and escapes obstacles/enemies EVERY time with scarcely ever more than a scratch. Characters are severely underdeveloped, almost no background story for anyone and their thought processes were illogical at times. Only bought it because it was mandatory reading for a class, waste of time. Everything that happened could have been summed up in 4 or 5 sentences, the rest of the book is boring, empty fluff."
